This year, the Korean tech giant decided to have fun at the <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/02/22/lg-g5-hands-on-video/\" target=\"_blank\">product unveiling</a>, and now with one of the wackiest all-action product ads we&#x2019;ve ever seen.</p>\n\n<p>Jason Statham, well known for hits roles in action movies like <em>The Transporter, Snatch</em>&#xA0;and <em>The Bank Job</em> plays quite literally, every role in LG&#x2019;s minute-long preview. Amongst all the stunts in this hectic fast-paced TV commercial, you&#x2019;ll spot the LG G5 and all of its modular &#x2018;friends&#x2019;, including the Plus Cam attachment, Rolling Bot and the VR headset.</p>\n<p>All the action starts on the Metro when two Stathams bump in to each other, trying to look over another two Stathams watching a video on a G5. What follows is a fight scene where the only weapons are brollies, which eventually spills on to the high street where further chaos, explosions, dancing, buffalo stampedes and a bank robbery ensues.</p>\n<p>With a cast of seemingly hundreds of individuals, Statham&#x2019;s face is stitched on to all the bodies. In short, it&#x2019;s a Jason Statham ego-fest with some LG product placement, and a splash of self-deprecating humor. It&#x2019;s wacky, and fantastic.
