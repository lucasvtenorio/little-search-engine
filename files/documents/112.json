Jide is beating Google&#xA0;to release today with a fully featured version of Remix OS 2.0 for its Ultratablet and&#xA0;the Nexus 9 and 10. ROMs for the two Nexus tablets&#xA0;are available to download now.</p>\n\n<p>While Remix OS gained prominence with a more <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/01/07/remix-os-desktop-android/\">polished version 2.0</a>, Jide has been making hardware and software since last year.&#xA0;The <a href=\"http://www.jide.com/remix-ultratablet\">Remix Ultratablet</a> was a Surface-like tablet with an attachable keyboard and adjustable stand that ran the first version of its operating system.&#xA0;Like on PCs, users were also&#xA0;able to flash a version of the&#xA0;OS&#xA0;on certain tablets.</p>\n<p>According to a spokesperson, Remix OS 2.0 for the Nexus 9 and 10 will have complete feature parity with&#xA0;the version found on&#xA0;PCs. This means floating resizable windows, a taskbar, notification panel, and more in the same Remix OS interface. Other features include a file manager that supports external storage and keyboard shortcuts.&#xA0;Since its announcement at CES, the OS has <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/02/22/remix-os-enters-beta/\">entered beta</a>&#xA0;with features like automatic OTA updates and many bug fixes.</p>\n<p>We&#x2019;ll have to wait and&#xA0;see what performance is like, but Jide has made great strides in the past month improving the performance of the OS on various PC desktops and laptops. For users of the Nexus 9 and unsupported Nexus 10, this will breathe new life and productivity into their devices.</p>\n<p>Users can download the <a href=\"https://otacdn.jide.com/thirdparty/images-aosp_flounder-2.0-5.1.1-B2016033103-signed.zip\">Nexus 9 ROM</a> and <a href=\"https://otacdn.jide.com/thirdparty/images-aosp_manta-2.0-5.1.1-B2016033002-signed.zip\">Nexus 10 ROM here</a>&#xA0;with install instructions being shortly available from&#xA0;their <a href=\"http://www.jide.com/\">site</a>.
