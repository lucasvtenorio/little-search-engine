Or at least that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re calling it until things become official, and from the sounds of the latest rumors and reports, there&#x2019;s a lot more up in the air than just the device&#x2019;s name when it comes to new features, design changes, and more.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One feature that will surely be a talking point for the new device is the lack of a headphone jack, something we&#x2019;ve speculated could come for quite a while now since Apple introduced support for <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2014/06/03/apple-introduces-mfi-specs-for-lightning-cable-headphones-support-arriving-in-future-ios-update/\" target=\"_blank\">headphones over its Lightning cable</a> back in 2014. <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/01/08/iphone-7-wireless-headphones-beats/\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Mark confirmed back in early January</b></span></a> that Apple is indeed planning on getting rid of the headphone jack, and that it&#x2019;s developing some truly cord-free wireless earbuds that could possibly launch with the device, but as of then Apple was still testing three different designs for the iPhone 7.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But the missing headphone jack&#xA0;may not be something that Apple tries to hide as a shortcoming and rather a feature it promotes as yet another example of it being first to fully embrace leaving aging technologies behind. It could allow for other advancements in the device&#x2014; a thinner design or extra space for other new components, for example&#x2013; and that&#x2019;s something Apple would&#xA0;surely talk up.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The different designs in testing could be partially the reason forthe conflicting reports and rumors in recent months regarding new features and design changes, but now that we&#x2019;re getting closer to launch this fall, we have a much better idea of what the next iPhone will look like. Here&#x2019;s what we know.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img title=\"iPhone 7: Everything we currently know about Apple's next flagship\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-422807\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/iphone-7-mockup.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=500\" alt=\"iphone-7-mockup\" width=\"1000\"></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Features |</b></span></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Rumored new features:</b> In addition to the usual internal upgrade for the device&#x2019;s processor, new features rumored for the iPhone 7 include a thinner design, a new dual camera system, a 256GB capacity option, a larger battery, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Fi\" target=\"_blank\">Li-Fi tech</a>, stereo speakers, and more.

Of course the lack of headphone jack will change the design of the device slightly, and I&#x2019;d expect Apple to talk about what removing the jack allowed for them from an innovation standpoint design-wise. But with all of that, the device is expected to overall be similar to the iPhone 6s design. </span><span class=\"s1\"><strong>What we know for sure:</strong> Mark <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/01/08/iphone-7-wireless-headphones-beats/\"><span class=\"s2\">reported in January</span></a> that Apple was testing three separate designs &#x201C;including a completely new, thinner look as well as a backup design that looks substantially like the iPhone 6s.&#x201D;</span></p>\n\n<p><img title=\"iPhone 7: Everything we currently know about Apple's next flagship\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-414192\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/hint.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=571\" alt=\"hint\" width=\"1000\"></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Accessories |</b></span></h2>\n<p>Wireless Earpods? If the wireless, cord-free Bluetooth earphones that Mark told us about in January are ready in time for the fall, these for me will be the best part of the iPhone 7 launch. Of course they&#x2019;ll likely work with previous generation devices as well (unless Apple figures out a creative way to prevent that), and it will make the removal of the headphone jack much easier to swallow for those that might not be overly excited about that change. I&#x2019;d expect Apple will bundle cheaper Lightning cable-based headphones with the iPhone 7 and sell&#xA0;these cord-free Beats as a premium accessory.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><img title=\"iPhone 7: Everything we currently know about Apple's next flagship\" class=\" wp-image-423163 alignright\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/fv_iphone_7_render_side_carbon.jpg?w=377&amp;h=457\" alt=\"fv_iphone_7_render_side_carbon\" width=\"377\">Polls |</b></span></h2>\n<p>And what do the people want?
