I&#x2019;ll have more on that in the full review. In the meantime, we&#x2019;ve unboxed the retail version of the G5 on video. The flagship smartphone, which boasts a new modular &#x201C;friends&#x201D; feature, is the follow up to LG&#x2019;s generally well received LG G4.</p>\n<p>This time around, LG has hit us with several new features, headlined by a&#xA0;detachable bottom lip that lets you add peripherals like a&#xA0;camera grip, additional batteries, and more. The modular design is unique, and serves as the major differentiator between the G5 and the competition. Have a look at our unboxing for&#xA0;a quick first glance at the retail G5.\n\t<ins class=\"adsbygoogle author_ad\"></ins>\n\n\t\t\n</p>\n<p>The LG G5&#x2019;s build materials are made up of a &#x201C;special aluminum alloy&#x201D; according to LG. While this material does contain aluminum, it also contains a healthy coat of primer, which was <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/04/01/lg-g5-teardown-plastic-build/\">mistaken</a> as&#xA0;plastic in a recent video.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/04/04/lg-g5-not-plastic/\">LG has since issued a statement</a>&#xA0;in attempt to clear up any misunderstanding about the device&#x2019;s build quality.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, that&#x2019;s not the type of press you want when launching a flagship smartphone, but in the end, a genuinely good product will be able to triumph over negative press.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite LG G4 features&#xA0;was its camera that came with&#xA0;manual controls. The LG G5 features similar manual controls, but ups the ante with dual rear cameras. The two rear-facing cameras, one 16MP and one 8MP, make it possible to&#xA0;snap regular and wide angle shots without using special lens attachments. I&#x2019;ve always appreciated LG&#x2019;s super-in-depth camera functionality, and its&#xA0;looking to build on the success of its previous outing.</p>\n<p><img title=\"LG G5 Unboxing: a first look at the retail package [Video]\" class=\"size-full wp-image-137747 aligncenter\" src=\"https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/lg-g5-camera.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=563\" alt=\"LG G5 Camera\" width=\"1000\"></p>\n<p>A fingerprint sensor has now been included beneath the dual cameras on the back of the G5. The fingerprint sensor serves double duty as a power/sleep button, a setup that Nexus 5X users will be familiar with.</p>\n<p>The G5&#x2019;s 5.3&#x2033; Quad HD IPS display features increased brightness levels, going from 500 to 850 nits. Both the Galaxy S7 and the G5 feature QHD displays, with the GS7 featuring a higher PPI thanks to a slightly smaller screen.</p>\n<h2>Unboxing</h2>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"704\" height=\"426\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/RNwV9lJd6YQ?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>But let&#x2019;s not beat around the bush any longer. The LG G5&#x2019;s flagship feature is its detachable bottom lip allowing for modular peripheral connectivity. Unfortunately, there aren&#x2019;t many peripherals available at launch, and I wasn&#x2019;t able to test one personally.</p>\n<p><img title=\"LG G5 Unboxing: a first look at the retail package [Video]\" class=\"size-full wp-image-137744 aligncenter\" src=\"https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/lg-g5-modular.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=563\" alt=\"LG G5 modular\" width=\"1000\"></p>\n<p>There are obvious downsides with this approach. For starters, you no longer have a unibody phone, and introducing moving parts means there&#x2019;s more chance for wear and tear. Another downside is that the &#x201C;friends&#x201D; (that&#x2019;s such a goofy name), aren&#x2019;t hot-swappable. By removing the bottom lip, you&#x2019;re removing the battery, which obviously causes the phone to immediately shut down.</p>\n<p>I definitely think that LG is on to something, although it&#x2019;s certainly not the first to explore modularity. I&#x2019;ll have much more to talk about this in an upcoming review.</p>\n<p><img title=\"LG G5 Unboxing: a first look at the retail package [Video]\" class=\"size-full wp-image-137743 aligncenter\" src=\"https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/lg-g5-box.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=563\" alt=\"LG G5 Box\" width=\"1000\"></p>\n<p>Software-wise, the LG G5 ships with Android 6.0.1, and although it&#x2019;s made sure to include some of its own apps and customizations, it&#x2019;s not inundated with annoying bloatware that can&#x2019;t be removed. One thing that some users may find puzzling is the fact that LG shipped the G5 without an app drawer. LG&#x2019;s Home 4.0 launcher, which is <a href=\"http://us.lgworld.com/store/webview/products/share/retrieveProductDetail.dev?c=US&amp;l=EN&amp;id=000001176671142&amp;pid=PID16020414719\">downloadable from LG&#x2019;s&#xA0;SmartWorld content store</a>, brings the familiar app drawer back for users who wish to have it.</p>\n<p>We&#x2019;ll have much more on the LG G5 in our upcoming review.
