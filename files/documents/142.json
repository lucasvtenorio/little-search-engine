Additionally, Chrome Dev for Android has removed merge tabs and has a redesigned bookmarks widget&#x2026;</p>\n\n<p>Users have been asking for Chrome to integrate with the Mac notification center since 2013.&#xA0;In the Chromium issue tracker, Google assigned this feature in August of 2014, but there hasn&#x2019;t been much progress until <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=326539#c25\">last September</a> when Chrome&#x2019;s notification feature was removed.</p>\n<p>Yesterday,&#xA0;a Googler <a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=326539#c40\">revealed</a> that they are actively working on integrating this feature. Users&#xA0;on the Canary channel can test it out <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/06/google-chrome-native-notification-center-how-to/\">by turning on&#xA0;the &#x2018;Enable native notifications&#x2019; flag</a>. However, the feature is not yet &#x201C;100% clear&#x201D; and there might be some roadblocks. The flag is also available on the Stable channel, but Google notes the most up-to-date&#xA0;behavior and UX is available in Canary.</p>\n<p>On the equivalent Dev channel for Android, Chrome has permanently removed the merged tabs feature that displayed individual tabs in multitasking view. In <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/03/17/chrome-new-tabs-default/\">Chrome 49</a>, the featured was turned off by default for new users and the feature will likely be removed in future versions. <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrome.dev\">Chrome Dev 51</a> has also finally updated the bookmarks widget and removed the small site previews for a simple list of links.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Abner Li", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/06/google-chrome-mac-notification-center/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/9uljhnor", "title": "Google tests Chrome notifications in Mac OS X notification center, removes merged tabs on Android", "excerpt": "Chrome 47 removed the rarely used notification center from desktops last year, but many Mac users have long wondered why the browser doesn&#x2019;t use the native OS X center&#xA0;for notifications.&hellip;", "direction": "ltr", "word_count": 234, "total_pages": 0, "next_page_id": null, "dek": null, "lead_image_url": null, "rendered_pages": 1, "date_published": "2016-04-06 18:18:45"}
