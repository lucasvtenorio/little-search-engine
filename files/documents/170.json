Speaking to <a href=\"http://www.wareable.com/casio/no-plans-for-casio-wsd-f10-smartwatch-launch-outside-us-or-japan-2540\">Wearable.com</a>, Casio stated that the company currently does not have plans to bring the smartwatch to any additional countries. Currently, the WSD-F10 is available in the United States and Japan only.</p>\n\n<p>&#x201C;At the moment there are only plans for the WSD-F10 to be stocked in the United States&#xA0;and Japan, with no confirmed date for UK release,&#x201D; a Casio spokesperson said. Casio&#x2019;s reasoning for limiting the launch is unclear at this point, but it&#x2019;s certainly a puzzling decision seeing that the United States and Japan represent only a fraction of the world&#x2019;s population.</p>\n<p>We went <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/01/08/casio-android-wear-video/\">hands-on with the Casio&#xA0;WSD-F10 back at CES</a> in January and noted that it&#x2019;s the most durable and rugged smartwatch we&#x2019;ve seen. The device is certified to military grade standards and can survive depths of up to 50 meters. Furthermore, the watch is full of sensors, including a pressure sensor, magnetic censor, accelerometer, and gyroscope. Perhaps most notably, though, the device has both a color and monochrome screen, with the later option providing up to 30 days of battery life.</p>\n<p>Despite its unique features, the WSD-F10 looks like it will only be available in the United States and Japan.
