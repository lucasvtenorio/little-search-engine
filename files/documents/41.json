FBI director James Comey told&#xA0;<em><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/07/technology/fbi-iphone-hack-san-bernardino/\" target=\"_blank\">CNN</a></em> that the method doesn&#x2019;t work with the latest iPhones.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The FBI director also said the purchased tool worked only on a &#x201C;narrow slice of phones&#x201D; that does not include the newest Apple models, or the 5S.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This fact also lends support to the <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/09/edward-snowden-fbi-apple/\" target=\"_blank\">main theory</a> about how the hack was performed &#x2026;</p>\n\n<p>Edward Snowden said that the auto-erase function <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/09/edward-snowden-fbi-apple/\" target=\"_blank\">can be bypassed</a> by copying the contents of flash memory, making some passcode attempts and then copying the original content back to the iPhone to reset the counter. But&#xA0;on phones with an A7 chip and later, the Secure Enclave also appears to register login attempts, meaning that even over-writing the flash memory would not override the auto-erase.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s not clear at this stage whether the FBI appreciates how big a clue it just gave to the method used. The agency last week said that it <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/29/fbi-iphone-hack-method/\" target=\"_blank\">may not reveal</a> to Apple the method used, and it repeated the same line to&#xA0;<em>CNN</em>, stating that it had still not reached a decision.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#x201C;We tell Apple, then they&#x2019;re going to fix it, then we&#x2019;re back where we started from,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We may end up there, we just haven&#x2019;t decided yet.&#x201D;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But unless the FBI is bluffing,&#xA0;it does mean that there&#x2019;s no loophole for Apple to close in future iPhones.</p>\n<p>The Senate Intelligence Committee is <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/18/penalize-tech-companies-for-not-decrypting-devices/\" target=\"_blank\">still considering</a> legislation that would compel tech companies to cooperate with law enforcement agencies to defeat encryption, but it was <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/07/white-house-fbi-apple/\" target=\"_blank\">revealed today</a> that this proposed bill does not have the support of the White House.</p>\n<p><em>Image:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.digitalforensicscience.com\" target=\"_blank\">digitalforensicscience.com</a></em></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Ben Lovejoy", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/07/fbi-iphone-hack-method-secure-enclave/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/eqbhoxj8", "title": "FBI officially confirms hack it used does not work with the iPhone 5s or later iPhones", "excerpt": "It has been&#xA0;widely speculated that the method used by the FBI to access the San Bernardino iPhone might not work with&#xA0;phones that have the Secure Enclave, and this has now been effectively&hellip;", "direction": "ltr", "word_count": 293, "total_pages": 0, "next_page_id": null, "dek": null, "lead_image_url": null, "rendered_pages": 1, "date_published": "2016-04-07 13:19:32"}
