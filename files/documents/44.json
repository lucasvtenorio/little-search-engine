{"content": "<div><div class=\"post-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Until today,&#xA0;the only way to get a premium Apple Watch Herm&#xE8;s band was to&#xA0;buy the band and watch together&#xA0;from the Apple Store, or <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1SC5Wr0\">buy a very-similar (and cheaper) knockoff band</a> and pretend it is genuine. It was also only offered in one color, fauve brown. That is all about to change however. Apple has&#xA0;announced that&#xA0;it will soon start selling Apple Watch Herm&#xE8;s bands standalone and in several new colors.</p>\n<p>Soon, customers will be able to buy Double Tour, Single Tour and Cuff bands separately in fauve brown, feu red, blanc white, blue pain green and blue saphir blue shades.</p>\n\n<p>Availability varies per Apple Watch model size, so not all colors are available for&#xA0;both the 38mm and 42 mm models. Pricing and a precise date for&#xA0;these standalone bands have also not been announced. The existing Apple Watch Herm&#xE8;s models come with a +$450 premium over the steel Watches, so don&#x2019;t expect&#xA0;them to be cheap.</p>\n<p>The expansion of the range allows existing Watch customers to add some premium style to their&#xA0;outfit, or are simply interested in more vibrant Herm&#xE8;s colors than the&#xA0;brown option that existed before. These standalone bands&#xA0;are also great candidates for gifts to friends and family, without having to shell out for a whole new Watch body at the same time.</p>\n<p>Last month, Apple&#xA0;refreshed the Apple Watch models with a&#xA0;<a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/21/apple-launches-variety-of-new-apple-watch-models-and-band-colors/\">variety of new bands and colors</a>, including a new set of nylon bands and a Space Black Milanese Loop. Expect the Hermes range to join the lineup soon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/07/apple-announces-standalone-apple-watch-hermes-bands-coming-soon-with-new-colors/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-10-38-14/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-426537\"><img title=\"Apple announces standalone Apple Watch Herm&#xE8;s bands coming soon with new colors\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-426537\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-10-38-14.png?w=1000&amp;h=528\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-04-07 at 10.38.14\" width=\"1000\"></a></p>\n<p><em>Thanks Alixrezax for the tip off.</em></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Benjamin Mayo", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/07/apple-announces-standalone-apple-watch-hermes-bands-coming-soon-with-new-colors/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/qb6tog82", "title": "Apple announces standalone Apple Watch Herm\u00e8s bands coming soon with new colors", "excerpt": "Until today,&#xA0;the only way to get a premium Apple Watch Herm&#xE8;s band was to&#xA0;buy the band and watch together&#xA0;from the Apple Store, or buy a very-similar (and cheaper) knockoff band&hellip;", "direction": "ltr", "word_count": 252, "total_pages": 0, "next_page_id": null, "dek": null, "lead_image_url": "https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-10-38-14.png?w=1000&h=528", "rendered_pages": 1, "date_published": "2016-04-07 09:43:32"}
