This never before seen robot made its</span><span>&#xA0;appearance as part of a&#xA0;keynote Rubin was giving at 2016&#xA0;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RakutenToday/status/718307923638755329\">New Economic Summit</a> in Tokyo.</span></p>\n<p>Unlike Boston Dynamics&#x2019; Atlas, the SCHAFT robot does not have arms to get back up in case it falls down.&#xA0;It can carry up to 132 pounds (60 kg) and navigate a variety of challenging and steep terrains, including dirt, rocks, and snow.&#xA0;<span>However, its most impressive feat is the ability to climb a variety of stairs.&#xA0;</span><span>In one demo, it balances a payload of food while traversing a stadium and in another it is walking across a rocky beach.</span></p>\n<p>As is typical of&#xA0;<a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2014/11/10/boston-dynamics-karate-kid-atlas/\">videos</a> from Boston Dynamics, there is a&#xA0;scene where the robot can successfully stay upright&#xA0;even as a human moves around a metal pole in hopes of making it fall down.&#xA0;<span>In a statement to </span><em><a href=\"http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/shaft-demos-new-bipedal-robot-in-japan\">IEEE Spectrum</a>,</em><span> an X spokesperson said that the presentation wasn&#x2019;t a product announcement and just a technical demonstration. It will likely still be a while before we see a mass market robot come out of Alphabet.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"704\" height=\"426\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/iyZE0psQsX0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\"></iframe></span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Abner Li", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/08/schaft-alphabet-robot/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/wrjtkbkp", "title": "Alphabet-owned SCHAFT shows off a stair climbing bipedal robot [Video]", "excerpt": "While Alphabet&#xA0;is rumored to sell&#xA0;Boston Dynamics due to a&#xA0;lack of &#x201C;marketable products&#x201D;, it still owns quite a few robot companies.&#xA0;This morning one of them&hellip;", "direction": "ltr", "word_count": 247, "total_pages": 0, "next_page_id": null, "dek": null, "lead_image_url": null, "rendered_pages": 1, "date_published": "2016-04-08 19:22:08"}
