Additionally, two devices with the Moto X3&#xA0;</span>moniker have hit an Indian&#xA0;import/export database that&#xA0;might allude to a release sooner than later.</p>\n\n<p>The Lenovo <a href=\"https://gfxbench.com/device.jsp?benchmark=gfx40&amp;os=Android&amp;api=gl&amp;D=Lenovo+XT1700&amp;testgroup=info\">XT1700</a> has a 5-inch 1280 x 720 display with a quad-core MediaTek processor, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of storage.&#xA0;There&#x2019;s a 7MP rear facing camera and a 4.7MP front facer. Interestingly, the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://gfxbench.com/device.jsp?benchmark=gfx40&amp;os=Android&amp;api=gl&amp;D=Lenovo+XT1706&amp;testgroup=info\">XT1706</a> variant&#xA0;appears to have identical specs and both run Android 6.0. The use of a&#xA0;MediaTek processor likely points to this device being a Moto E rather than the G, but considering that most phones with MediaTek processors are from Chinese manufacturers like Huawei, Blu, and ZTE, even that seems odd.&#xA0;Depending on the variant, the 2nd generation Moto E used a lower-end&#xA0;Snapdragon 200 or 410 chip.</p>\n<p>Additionally, two devices recently hit Indian import/export database Zauba under the&#xA0;Moto X3. Devoid of specs, the listings are nearly identical and might be the same device mentioned above. Last year&#x2019;s Moto X Pure Edition is considered the 3rd generation of that device, so &#x201C;X3&#x201D; doesn&#x2019;t seem likely to refer to the Moto X.</p>\n<p>At CES, Lenovo announced they would begin <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/01/07/lenovo-phasing-out-motorola/\">phasing out</a> the Motorola brand name for &#x2018;by Lenovo&#x2019; and mentioned that future Moto phones would have screens <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/01/12/moto-phone-2016/\">larger than five inches</a>. It appears that Lenovo is opting to increase the screen size of the lower-end Moto models as they previously confirmed they <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/01/13/moto-g-moto-e-not-dead/\">would not kill off</a>&#xA0;the Moto G or E.</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Abner Li", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/04/moto-e-3rd-gen-by-lenovo-benchmarks/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/7w7ulsku", "title": "Possible 3rd-gen Moto E and first \u2018by Lenovo\u2019 device appear in benchmarks", "excerpt": "A pair of listings on GFXbench (via WinFuture) have revealed two Lenovo phones that may&#xA0;possibly be the next generation Moto E.
