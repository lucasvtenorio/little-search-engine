The perfect example was last year, when Google effectively sherlocked dozens of lyrics-dedicated websites by <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2014/12/22/song-lyrics-knowledge-graph/\">adding its own lyrics directly to the top of search results</a> for many songs. I don&#x2019;t think as many websites are going to feel the brunt of this change, but Google has now added animal sounds to Search&#x2026;\n\t<ins class=\"adsbygoogle author_ad\"></ins>\n\n\t\t\n</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s pretty straightforward and you can try the feature right now. Just search for &#x201C;animal sounds,&#x201D; &#x201C;animal noises,&#x201D; or a query like &#x201C;tiger sounds&#x201D; or &#x201C;whale sounds&#x201D;. The variety of animals that Google lists is pretty vast, including a sound for pig, dog, sheep, ape, whale, and more. As noted by <a href=\"http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2016/04/google-animal-sounds.html\">Google Operating System blog</a>,&#xA0;Google is using MP3 files&#xA0;for playing the sounds, so they should work fine in most modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.) that have support for HTML5 audio.</p>\n<p>If you have kids that need to learn more about these animals or simply want to waste the next 10 minutes at work, then go&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&amp;q=animal+sounds\">try it out!</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Stephen Hall", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/05/google-can-now-play-animal-sounds-directly-from-search/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/kr0md3kw", "title": "Google can now play animal sounds directly from search", "excerpt": "Very often, Google realizes that there&#x2019;s a common search query that it can make&#xA0;more convenient&#xA0;for users by adding its own content directly to the search engine.
