Modular internal components play a large part in iFixit giving&#xA0;the LG G5 <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/LG+G5+Teardown/61205\">the same repairability score</a> as the <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2015/06/08/lg-g4-ifixit-teardown/\">G4 before it</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Getting into the phone is as easy as sliding out the removable battery module and removing two standard Phillips #00&#xA0;screws. Being a long-time advocate of removable batteries to prolong a phone&#x2019;s lifespan, iFixit is very happy with modular unibody phone. Additionally, the lack of adhesive and few screws on the main part of the phone is also considered a plus.</p>\n<p>The only part that uses a significant amount of adhesive is the phone&#x2019;s modular chin that houses the&#xA0;USB Type-C port, speaker, and several antennas. However, getting a chin replacement should be easy to do.</p>\n<p>The teardown notes that LG used a different fingerprint sensor than the one found in the <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2015/10/22/nexus-5x-teardown-repairability/\">Nexus 5X</a>. As most recently seen on the cheaper Nexus&#xA0;device, LG again uses spring contacts to attach&#xA0;many&#xA0;components inside the phone. In theory, it would be very easy to pull out a broken part and snap in a new one.&#xA0;Like on other phones, the display assembly is fused and would require replacing the entire part if the LCD or glass shatters.</p>\n<p>iFixit praises LG for &#x201C;finally figur[ing] out the modular unibody&#x201D; and gives the G5 a 8/10 repairability score. They add&#xA0;that &#x201C;the display is seamlessly mounted in the rear case, making for a luxury feel&#x2014;while still maintaining battery access. We hope this trend catches on.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><img title=\"iFixit teardown reveals easily-repairable LG G5 has modular components inside and out\" class=\"size-large wp-image-137859 aligncenter\" src=\"https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/kevl1lusltebsovo.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=750\" alt=\"KEVL1LUslTEBSoVO\" width=\"1000\"></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Abner Li", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/06/lg-g5-ifixit-teardown/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/m6ciojfm", "title": "iFixit teardown reveals easily-repairable LG G5 has modular components inside and out", "excerpt": "While Samsung continues to make&#xA0;their phones harder to repair, LG&#x2019;s devices remain relatively easy to fix.
