{"content": "<div><div class=\"post-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Traditionally, when it comes to Android developer previews, Google only makes the pre-release software available to the <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/nexus\" target=\"_blank\">Nexus</a> smartphone and tablet lineup. This year, it&#x2019;s already broken with tradition by <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/03/09/android-n-factory-images-download/\" target=\"_blank\">releasing the first developer preview</a> of <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/android-n\" target=\"_blank\">Android N</a> earlier than usual, and it could throw another curve ball by making a version available to non-Nexus owners.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to a discovery by Redditor, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidPreviews/comments/4dl8us/n_general_android_beta_program_coming_to_oem/\" target=\"_blank\">FUNExtreme</a>, we see that digging&#xA0;in to the code&#xA0;the developer preview <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/preview/overview.html#timeline\" target=\"_blank\">&#x2018;program overview&#x2019; page</a>, there&#x2019;s a reference to other OEMS. It seems to suggested that &#x2014; later in the preview &#x2014; more devices will be supported, including those &#x201C;from OEM partners&#x201D;.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&lt;!&#x2013;\n&lt;p&gt;New in the Android N Developer Preview: &lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Accompanying Android Beta Program for consumers, starting later in the preview&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; More supported devices, including devices from OEM partners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt; Seamless OTAs for your devices, from initial release to final N release without flashing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&#x2013;&gt;</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#x2019;s worth noting, this could very well be Google playing games with us. After all, it&#x2019;s not unlike the company to troll us with &#x2018;hidden&#x2019; suggestions or information leading up to a major software launch.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s also worth noting that it could be a simple reiteration of what the company already told us; that it will be releasing Android N dev preview to OEMs for testing sooner than usual.</p>\n<p>When the first developer preview <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/03/09/android-n-summer-public-beta/\" target=\"_blank\">was announced</a>, the company announced that a public beta would be starting later on in the year, and that OEM partners would get earlier access to testing. This doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean that customers using these non-Nexus phones will definitely get beta access. Rather, just that manufacturers get to test it earlier than normal, with the aim to roll it out quicker.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Developer preview page code suggests Android N beta might land on non-Nexus phones\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-137933\" src=\"https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-07-at-11-48-19.png?w=1000&amp;h=507\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-04-07 at 11.48.19\" width=\"1000\"></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Cam Bunton", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/07/android-n-developer-preview-new-handsets/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/063rbclu", "title": "Developer preview page code suggests Android N beta might land on non-Nexus phones", "excerpt": "Traditionally, when it comes to Android developer previews, Google only makes the pre-release software available to the Nexus smartphone and tablet lineup.
