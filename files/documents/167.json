{"content": "<div><div class=\"post-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>As many of you will undoubtedly know, Apple recently unveiled and <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/21/apple-event-march-2016-live-blog-iphone-se-ipad-pro-apple-watch/\" target=\"_blank\">launched the iPhone SE</a>. Essentially, it&#x2019;s an iPhone 6s inside the iPhone 5&#x2019;s body with a few exceptions. But it turns out an Android OEM may be planning an &#x2018;SE&#x2019; version of its own phones. Trademarks filed by LG suggest the company has been planning a G5 SE since as long ago as December.</p>\n\n<p>Korean site, Kipris, shows a <a href=\"http://engdtj.kipris.or.kr/engdtj/searchLogina.do?method=loginTM&amp;checkPot=Y\" target=\"_blank\">searchable list</a> of Korean trademarks. Having been pointed in <a href=\"http://www.phonearena.com/news/Aaaand-of-course-LG-trademarks-the-G5-SE-name_id79935\" target=\"_blank\">that direction</a> by <em>PhoneArena</em>, we found&#xA0;at least four separate versions of G5 SE branding applied for by LG CORP and/or LG Electronics Inc. Probably not coincidentally, two of those &#x2014; specifically two versions of &#x2018;LG G5 SE&#x2019; &#x2014; were applied for eight days after Apple announced the iPhone SE on March 21st. A single G5 SE trademark&#xA0;was applied for on <a target=\"_blank\">February 19th</a>, and an earlier one is dated December 30th, 2015.</p>\n<p>While it&#x2019;s easy to jump to the conclusion that LG copied Apple, it may not actually be the case. The earliest mention of the iPhone &#x2018;SE&#x2019; or &#x2018;5SE&#x2019; as a rumor came on <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/01/22/apple-readies-iphone-5se-not-6c-for-marchapril-with-curved-edges-live-photos/\" target=\"_blank\">January 22nd from 9to5Mac this year</a>&#xA0;meaning LG first had the name registered before the iPhone&#x2019;s name was rumored the first time.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, LG does launch smaller version of its G-series smartphones, but does so with the &#x2018;C&#x2019; moniker. While we wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised to see an Android OEM follow Apple&#x2019;s naming strategy, it would be a break in tradition for LG if it did so. It hasn&#x2019;t launched a smaller version of the G5 yet, but we expect the company <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/03/25/lg-g5-lite-tenaa/\" target=\"_blank\">will at some point</a> regardless of whether they stick with &#x2018;C&#x2019;, &#x2018;Lite&#x2019; or use &#x2018;SE&#x2019; as its name.</p>\n<p>The bigger question here is whether or not the OEM can create a competitive low-cost device. The smaller&#xA0;models in the past have been very lack lustre, to say the least, as we found out <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2015/09/10/lg-g4c-review-video/\" target=\"_blank\">with the LG G4c</a> last summer. If LG can bring its &#x2018;<a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/04/04/lg-g5-not-plastic/\" target=\"_blank\">metal build</a>&#x2018; to the smaller form factor, and release a product with competitive specifications at a price below $350, the LG G5c could do well. If it follows previous years&#x2019; traditions, it may as well not be put on store shelves at all.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Cam Bunton", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/05/lg-g5-se-trademark/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/p6h1zotz", "title": "LG registers \u2018G5 SE\u2019 trademark, smaller device incoming or just Apple-inspired naming?", "excerpt": "As many of you will undoubtedly know, Apple recently unveiled and launched the iPhone SE.
