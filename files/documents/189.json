Between April 3rd&#xA0;and April 10th, T-Mobile customers can sign up for a free year of MLB.TV Premium service, a $109.99 value, that&#xA0;features live games for the entire 2016 MLB season.\n\t<ins class=\"adsbygoogle author_ad\"></ins>\n\n\t\t\n</p>\n<h2>How to get free MLB.TV premium service for a year</h2>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Disconnect from Wi-Fi on your device&#xA0;and ensure that you&#x2019;re connected to the T-Mobile network.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Visit <a href=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=7a2391b463babd83c5480aad3d83ccba&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2FT-Mobile.com%2FMLB\" target=\"_blank\">T-Mobile.com/MLB</a></p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scroll down the page and tap the Sign Up button.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you already have a free MLB.com account, use that to sign in; otherwise, you&#x2019;ll need to set one up under the <em>Register</em> heading.&#xA0;There, you&#x2019;ll be asked to submit your email address, password, and birth date.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once your account is created, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bamnetworks.mobile.android.gameday.atbat&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">download the MLB.com At Bat app from Google Play</a>, and login with your MLB.com account.</p>\n<p>Congratulations. You can now watch free live streamed MLB games for the entire 2016 season. Keep in mind that blackouts still apply.</p>\n<p>This is one of the best perks that I&#x2019;ve seen a wireless carrier offer its customers in quite some time. If you&#x2019;re a baseball fan who happens to use T-Mobile, then be sure to take advantage of this awesome offer before April 10th.</p>\n<p>As an added bonus, live streams from the MLB.com At Bat app are eligible for T-Mobile&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/17/t-mobile-adds-youtube-google-play-movies-much-more-to-binge-on-data-free-streaming/\">controversial Binge On feature</a>. BingeOn, as we&#x2019;ve talked about in the past, allows customers to stream content for free without it counting against their data balance. This means that not only can you get free access to a year&#x2019;s worth of live MLB games, but you can watch them on the go without incurring data usage if you&#x2019;re on the right T-Mobile plan.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Jordan Kahn", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/03/how-to-get-a-free-year-of-mlb-tv-premium-if-youre-a-t-mobile-customer-a-109-99-value/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/j9mjbnhg", "title": "How to get a free year of MLB.TV Premium if you\u2019re a T-Mobile customer, a $109.99 value", "excerpt": "T-Mobile may not traditionally have the MLB coverage that bigger providers like AT&amp;T and Verizon possess, but no one can argue that it isn&#x2019;t trying to do everything in its power to stand&hellip;", "direction": "ltr", "word_count": 312, "total_pages": 0, "next_page_id": null, "dek": null, "lead_image_url": null, "rendered_pages": 1, "date_published": "2016-04-03 14:10:41"}
