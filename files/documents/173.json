It goes without saying that this is read as a foreign language to anyone without a development background, Google says that it &#xA0;has &#x201C;redesigned the underlying architecture that supports the cross-platform API for accessing Datastore outside of&#xA0;<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/appengine/\" target=\"_blank\">Google App Engine</a>, such as from&#xA0;<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Container Engine</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compute/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Compute Engine</a>&#x201C;&#x2026;</p>\n\n<p>Google says that this should &#x201C;dramatically [improve]&#xA0;performance and reliability of the database.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Here are the details:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the new release, we re-architected the entire serving path with an eye on performance and reliability. Cloud Datastore API revision v1beta3 has lower latency in both the average and long tail cases. Whether it&#x2019;s magical items transferring to a player&#x2019;s inventory faster, or browsing financial reports on a website that&#x2019;s snappy&#xA0;&#x2014;&#xA0;everyone loves fast.</p>\n<p>In addition to these significant performance improvements, the v1beta3 API gives us a new platform upon which we can continue to improve performance and functionality.</p>\n<p>You can use v1beta3 using the idiomatic&#xA0;<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sdk/cloud-client-libraries\" target=\"_blank\">Google Cloud Client Libraries</a>&#xA0;(in Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and Ruby), or alternatively via the low-level native client libraries for JSON and Protocol Buffers over gRPC.
