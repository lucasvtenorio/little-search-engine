The TimePorter case resembles a premium eyeglass case, and includes space to hold the Apple Watch charging cable, extra Watch bands, and the USB charger. The case also doubles as a charging stand and Apple Watch display when opened up.</p>\n\n<p>Available in a Mod White or Jet Black, the TimePorter is wrapped in a luxury leather material.&#xA0;When opened, the hinges move to a full 180-degrees allowing the&#xA0;Watch to rest on top as it charges. The interior space is roomy enough to coil and store the six-foot long Apple charging cable making management a breeze. The case appears to be an extremely convenient way to carry the Apple Watch and any other smaller accessories you may have on hand.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/07/twelve-south-timeporter-apple-watch/abbb137bf5cdd68bbafc692ab0f8a5194aa4f4a1/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-426588\"><img title=\"Twelve South introduces new TimePorter capsule for Apple Watch and charger\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-426588\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/abbb137bf5cdd68bbafc692ab0f8a5194aa4f4a1.jpg?w=655&amp;h=337\" alt=\"TimePorter Interior\" width=\"655\"></a></p>\n<p>The TimePorter will be available and begin shipping early May for $49.99. <a href=\"https://app.e2ma.net/app2/audience/signup/1810024/1400299/\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up here</a> to be notified when it becomes available.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Greg Barbosa", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/07/twelve-south-timeporter-apple-watch/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/vshcyig9", "title": "Twelve South introduces new TimePorter capsule for Apple Watch and charger", "excerpt": "Twelve South today has unveiled their new&#xA0;TimePorter travel tote and portable charging stand for the Apple Watch.
