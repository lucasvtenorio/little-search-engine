{"content": "<div><div class=\"post-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Apple&#x2019;s plan to&#xA0;sell used iPhones in <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/tag/india/\" target=\"_blank\">India</a> to&#xA0;bring new customers into the Apple ecosystem has met with strong opposition, reports&#xA0;<em><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-03/apple-s-push-to-flood-india-with-used-iphones-ignites-backlash\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a></em>. A newly-formed lobbying group has sent a letter to the government asking it to deny Apple the official approval it would need to begin the sales &#x2013; and one of the companies behind the group is Samsung.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#x201C;Why even consider allowing import of used phones when import of other used goods such as cars are precluded by 300 percent duty levies?&#x201D; asked Ravinder Zutshi, chairman of the newly formed Mobile and Communications Council, which issued the letter. The group&#x2019;s members include the largest Indian phone brands: Micromax, Intex and Samsung &#x2026;&#xA0;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple&#x2019;s long-term hope is that India will be the next China: a high-population developing nation&#xA0;with huge potential as the emerging middle class grows. Right now, though,&#xA0;such plans are in their infancy, with Apple&#x2019;s share of the smartphone market sitting at less than two percent.</p>\n<p>While interest in&#xA0;the <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/tag/iphone-se/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone SE</a>&#xA0;is <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/30/apple-iphone-se-sales-india-china/\" target=\"_blank\">strong in India</a>, it will still have limited impact in a market where 80% of smartphones cost less than $150 and major manufacturers use special &#x2018;India only&#x2019; pricing. Selling used iPhones would have allowed Apple to compete on price without sacrificing either margins or its aspirational image, as well as providing&#xA0;a large potential market for the used iPhones the company collected through its <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/tag/iphone-upgrade-program/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone Upgrade Program</a>.</p>\n<p>But local companies complain that allowing Apple to flood the country with used iPhones without paying the usual heavy import duties would make a nonsense of the government&#x2019;s Made in India program, established to incentivise local manufacturing. Some also argue that more used products will add to the country&#x2019;s electronic waste problem as older phones reach the end of their useful lives, though this argument seems less persuasive given&#xA0;Apple&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/17/recycled-iphone-what-happens/\" target=\"_blank\">commitment</a> to <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/21/apple-svp-lisa-jackson-details-apples-environmental-effort-including-recycling-program-during-event/\" target=\"_blank\">recycling</a>.</p>\n<p>The government last year turned down an earlier request from Apple, and will now need to reach a decision on this latest application.</p>\n<p>Apple will in any case be pushing ahead with its <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2015/09/16/tim-cook-narendra-modi-india/\" target=\"_blank\">expansion plans</a> for the country, including its first official <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/04/tim-cook-india-iphone-apple-watch-android/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Stores</a>. It was reported <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/04/tim-cook-india-iphone-apple-watch-android/\" target=\"_blank\">last month</a> that these plans include a flagship store based on the iconic Fifth Avenue design.</p>\n<p><em>Photo: <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters</a></em></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Ben Lovejoy", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/04/used-iphones-india-apple-micromax-intex/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/oivzznc7", "title": "Apple\u2019s plans to boost iPhone uptake in India thru used sales opposed by Samsung & others", "excerpt": "Apple&#x2019;s plan to&#xA0;sell used iPhones in India to&#xA0;bring new customers into the Apple ecosystem has met with strong opposition, reports&#xA0;Bloomberg.
