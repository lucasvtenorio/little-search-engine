It was unclear, however, if the development of the FBI unlocking the San Bernardino iPhone would spill over into the New York case and make the court case unnecessary.</p>\n<p>The FBI has since said as much that the exploit used to access the San Bernardino iPhone is only effective against the iPhone 5c (and presumably earlier) and not the iPhone 5s and later, which includes a Secure Element that increases hardware and software security.</p>\n<p>Today&#x2019;s development that the Department of Justice will indeed push forward on going through the court system to require Apple to unlock a different encrypted iPhone seems to&#xA0;<a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/30/apple-fbi-new-york-case/\" target=\"_blank\">validate</a>&#xA0;the FBI&#x2019;s statement.</p>\n<p>While this case doesn&#x2019;t seem to be quite as heated as the San Bernardino iPhone one, the same principles apply and it&#x2019;s clear that the debate over encryption, privacy, and security isn&#x2019;t going anywhere anytime soon. We&#x2019;ll continue tracking the case.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Zac Hall", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/08/doj-ny-iphone-encryption-case/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/xhx3zznh", "title": "DOJ will pursue NY iPhone encryption case in court, suggesting FBI hacking method doesn\u2019t apply", "excerpt": "The San Bernardino iPhone case over encryption may be over for now after the FBI managed to break into the iPhone 5c used by one of the shooters, but the same isn&#x2019;t true for another&hellip;", "direction": "ltr", "word_count": 332, "total_pages": 0, "next_page_id": null, "dek": null, "lead_image_url": null, "rendered_pages": 1, "date_published": "2016-04-08 15:27:25"}
