The change of policy comes as part of a major update to elderly White House technology.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Until very recently, West Wing aides were stuck in a sad and stunning state of technological inferiority: desktop computers from the last decade, black-and-white printers that could not do double-sided copies, aging BlackBerries (no iPhones), weak wireless Internet and desktop phones so old that few staff members knew how to program the speed-dial buttons [&#x2026;]</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Many White House aides now carry the most recent iPhones.
