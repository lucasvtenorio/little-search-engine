{"content": "<div><div class=\"post-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Less than a month after a critical Flash vulnerability allowed an attacker to <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/11/flash-critical-vulnerability/\" target=\"_blank\">take control</a> of a Mac, Adobe has issued an emergency update for yet another critical&#xA0;flaw. The latest one is already being&#xA0;exploited by ransomware that encrypts Windows PCs, but while there&#x2019;s no known exploit for OS X as yet, Adobe <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb16-10.html\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> that the same vulnerability exists on all platforms, and users should update immediately &#x2026;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Adobe has released security updates for Adobe Flash Player for Windows, Macintosh, Linux and ChromeOS. &#xA0;These updates address critical vulnerabilities that could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Adobe is aware of reports that CVE-2016-1019 is being actively exploited on systems running Windows 10 and earlier with Flash Player version 20.0.0.306 and earlier.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Apple often <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2015/04/21/apple-safari-adobe-flash-block/\"><span class=\"s2\">blocks</span></a>&#xA0;vulnerable versions of Flash in Safari, but as that takes time, it&#x2019;s best not to rely on this. You can update&#xA0;</span><span class=\"s1\">your version of Flash by visiting&#xA0;<a href=\"https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/\"><span class=\"s2\">Adobe&#x2019;s update page</span></a>&#xA0;and hitting&#xA0;the &#x2018;Install now&#x2019; button.&#xA0;Flash updates should, of course, be refused from other sites&#xA0;as it&#x2019;s not unusual for malware-infected fake versions to be offered.</span></p>\n<p>Given the <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2015/10/15/adobe-flash-critical-vulnerability/\" target=\"_blank\">succession</a> of vulnerabilities <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2015/06/24/flash-player-security-fix/\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> in Flash, Steve Jobs&#x2019; <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/\" target=\"_blank\">2010 essay</a> seems as relevant today as it was then. With an increasing number of people opting to zap Flash from their systems altogether, I think I&#x2019;m going to try the experiment myself.</p>\n<p><em>Via and photo: <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-adobe-systems-cyber-ransomware-idUSKCN0X502K?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters</a></em></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Ben Lovejoy", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/08/emergency-flash-update/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/5ib6gzn3", "title": "Another month, another Flash vulnerability \u2026 Adobe issues emergency update", "excerpt": "Less than a month after a critical Flash vulnerability allowed an attacker to take control of a Mac, Adobe has issued an emergency update for yet another critical&#xA0;flaw.
