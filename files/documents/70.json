{"content": "<div><div class=\"post-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>At a time when so many <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/tag/facebook/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> posts comprise a photo and a brief comment, there&#x2019;s one group of people who get rather left out of the picture: those who are blind and partially sighted. That&#x2019;s a problem Facebook is fixing, starting from today. The iOS app now uses artificial intelligence to figure out the content of photos, and Apple&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/tag/voiceover/\" target=\"_blank\">VoiceOver</a> feature to read aloud&#xA0;a description of them.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/5/11364914/facebook-automatic-alt-tags-blind-visually-impared\" target=\"_blank\">The Verge</a></em> got a demo of the feature, which Facebook calls &#x2018;automatic alt text.&#x2019;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Automatic alt text, which is coming to iOS today and later to Android and the web, recognizes objects in photos using machine learning [&#x2026;] While still in its early stages, the technology can reliably identify concepts in categories including transportation (&#x201C;car,&#x201D; &#x201C;boat,&#x201D; &#x201C;airplane&#x201D;), nature (&#x201C;snow,&#x201D; &#x201C;ocean,&#x201D; &#x201C;sunset&#x201D;), sports (&#x201C;basketball court&#x201D;), and food (&#x201C;sushi&#x201D;). The technology can also describe people (&#x201C;baby,&#x201D; &#x201C;smiling,&#x201D; beard&#x201D;), and identify a selfie.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Facebook said that there were two approaches it could have taken to the problem, and it chose the one it believed would be most successful &#x2026;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Matt King, a Facebook engineer who is blind, [&#x2026;] said&#xA0;</span><span class=\"s1\">&#x201C;We could probably require people when they upload a photo: &#x2018;please describe this for blind people.&#x2019; It would drive people nuts &#x2014; that would never work at scale.&#x201D; (This is <span class=\"s2\">the actual approach Twitter is taking to the problem</span>, though adding descriptions is optional.)</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Facebook says that it was conscious of the <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/1/8880363/google-apologizes-photos-app-tags-two-black-people-gorillas\" target=\"_blank\">risks of misidentification</a>, so the algorithm only tags photos with keywords if it is 80% certain &#x2013; but applies a higher confidence requirement to sensitive topics, such as someone&#x2019;s race.</p>\n<p>King says the company is aware that this is just a start, and that there are still &#x2018;millions&#x2019; of things the AI can&#x2019;t identify, but that it will improve over time and make a huge difference to blind users.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The impact of doing something like this is really telling people who are blind, your ability to participate in the social conversation that&#x2019;s going on around the world is really important to us. It&#x2019;s saying as a person, you matter, and we care about you. We want to include everybody &#x2014; and we&#x2019;ll do what it takes to include everybody.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">VoiceOver is one of a range of accessibility features built into iOS. Apple last year created a <a href=\"https://9to5mac.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post-new.php\" target=\"_blank\">catalog of apps</a> that take advantage of the feature, the same year that the American Foundation for the Blind <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2015/05/06/american-foundation-for-the-blind-apple-voiceover/\" target=\"_blank\">honored Apple</a> for the technology.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Ben Lovejoy", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/05/facebook-blind-users-automatic-alt-text/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/dim9wzza", "title": "Facebook\u2019s iOS app uses AI and VoiceOver to describe the contents of photos to blind users", "excerpt": "At a time when so many Facebook posts comprise a photo and a brief comment, there&#x2019;s one group of people who get rather left out of the picture: those who are blind and partially sighted.&hellip;", "direction": "ltr", "word_count": 404, "total_pages": 0, "next_page_id": null, "dek": null, "lead_image_url": null, "rendered_pages": 1, "date_published": "2016-04-05 10:58:02"}
