Now, RCA has revealed<a href=\"http://www.streamingmedia.com/PressRelease/View.aspx?PRGuid=41171\">&#xA0;details</a> and pricing for&#xA0;its new line of 4K Android TV sets that will be&#xA0;available in June.</p>\n\n<p>All models&#xA0;across the line will have a 4K Ultra HD 120Hz panel. The flagship XLD55G65RQ set&#xA0;has a 55-inch screen, but it will also come in 50- and 65-inch models. Design-wise, each size will have two variants: a standard slim line with a modern high-gloss black cabinet and a premium metal slim line.</p>\n<p>To address the lack of 4K content beyond a splattering of&#xA0;YouTube videos and Netflix, the sets have an &#x201C;advanced upscaling engine to enhance lower resolution 1080p to near 4K quality.&#x201D; Presumably, these sets will be on the latest <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/02/22/marshmallow-nvidia-shield-android-tv/\">Marshmallow</a> version of Android TV that&#xA0;features a refreshed interface and launcher. Google will likely&#xA0;maintain Google Cast and Android TV in parallel, as Android TV&#xA0;includes full Cast capabilities and lets users download games and other apps from the Play Store to their televisions.</p>\n<p>The RCA Android TVs&#xA0;will be available nationwide in June from Walmart, Sears, hhgregg, Target, Brandsmart and Rent-a-Center. The 50-inch model starts at $499, 55-inch at $699, and 65-inch at $999. The premium design model costs an extra $100.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Abner Li", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/11/rca-4k-android-tv/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/l9nzltip", "title": "Affordable RCA 4K Android TVs will be available in June, starting at $499 for 50-inch model", "excerpt": "While Google&#x2019;s latest approach to smart TVs involves Google Cast, Android TV is still around with new partners and models announced at CES earlier in the year.
