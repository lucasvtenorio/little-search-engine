The main view&#xA0;after signing in has gone through a reorganization, making accessing&#xA0;various sections much easier. Moving primary links into a&#xA0;left sidebar view, developer&#x2019;s can now quickly access their <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/tag/cloudkit/\" target=\"_blank\">CloudKit</a> Dashboard, Documentation, and even the Bug Reporter.</p>\n\n<p>Though none of the links or resources on the visually refreshed page&#xA0;are considered new to developers, Apple has done a nice job of making them more prominent and easier to find. The visual update may be slowly rolling out or not fully completed as just clicking on the <em>Certificates, Identifiers, &amp; Profiles&#xA0;</em>brings you directly back to the previous look.</p>\n<p>You can get a glimpse of what the previous Developer Center looked like just last week with Jeff Benjamin&#x2019;s tutorial on creating a <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/27/how-to-create-free-apple-developer-account-sideload-apps/\" target=\"_blank\">free developer account</a>.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Greg Barbosa", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/07/apple-developer-center-visual-update/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/onlnrqtu", "title": "Apple Developer Center revamped with new account page interface", "excerpt": "It looks like Apple&#x2019;s Developer Center&#xA0;is getting a visual refresh as the developer center&#xA0;account page&#xA0;has been updated today with some notable changes.
