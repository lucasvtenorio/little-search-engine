Before his death from bone cancer, 13-year-old Dama Fabbretti had added his father&#x2019;s thumbprint to allow him access &#x2013; but the phone required the passcode after a restart, and his father doesn&#x2019;t know the code.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Apple had told him&#xA0;it was impossible to access the iPhone without the passcode, but Fabretti told <em>CNN</em> that&#xA0;Cellebrite has already made progress &#x2026;</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#x201C;I just came back from their office in northern Italy. The meeting went well. They were able to download the directories with the iPhone&#x2019;s content, but there is still work to be done in order to access the files,&#x201D; Fabbretti said.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Those files contain the months of photos and conversations the dad so desperately wants to see, including a handful of videos taken three days before his son died.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Fabbretti said that the company had told him it was &#x2018;optimistic&#x2019; about its chances of accessing the files.&#xA0;Both Apple and Cellebrite refused to comment on the case.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The FBI last week advised&#xA0;that the method used to access the San Bernardino phone <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/07/fbi-iphone-hack-method-secure-enclave/\" target=\"_blank\">does&#xA0;not work</a> on the iPhone 5s or later, which appeared to confirm <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/29/opinion-fbi-apple-not-over-yet/\" target=\"_blank\">earlier speculation</a> that the passcode bypass would not work on models with a <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/tag/secure-enclave/\" target=\"_blank\">Secure Enclave</a>. If Cellebrite has a new method that successfully breaks into&#xA0;the iPhone 6, that will leave Apple with further work to do to secure <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/tag/iphone-7/\" target=\"_blank\">future iPhones</a>.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Ben Lovejoy", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/11/cellebrite-iphone-6-hack-optimistic/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/guxcvozo", "title": "Company which accessed San Bernardino iPhone 5c \u2018optimistic\u2019 it can also access iPhone 6", "excerpt": "Cellebrite, the company widely believed to have accessed the San Bernardino iPhone for the FBI, is reportedly &#x2018;optimistic&#x2019; that it will also be able to access a locked iPhone 6.
