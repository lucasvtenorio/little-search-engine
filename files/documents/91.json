CEO Tim Cook earlier this year <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/04/tim-cook-india-iphone-apple-watch-android/\"><span class=\"s2\">informed employees</span></a> that Apple plans on moving employees into the building by the end of January, while the company plans to wrap up final work on building construction and street utilities by the end of 2016. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Notable in the flyover is the rapid progress Apple has made on the exterior of the main circular building, which you&#x2019;ll now notice has started to take shape with the installation of many of the curved glass panels&#x2014;the largest in the world&#x2014; that surround the inner and outer exterior of the main &#x201C;spaceship&#x201D; building. Apple had already installed around 900 of the 3000 46-foot-long glass panels <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/07/apple-campus-2-theatre-events-photos/\"><span class=\"s2\">as of last month</span></a>, and it&#x2019;s made quite a bit of progress since then. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But you&#x2019;ll also see Apple has started putting finishing touches on the outside of the new 1,000 seat Theatre separate from the main building that the company will use to host future events and product unveilings. As well as continuing preparations for the installation of&#xA0;solar panels on top of&#xA0;buildings across the site.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"embed-youtube\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"704\" height=\"426\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/RvOowFwRn10?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;start=49&amp;wmode=transparent\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As always, you can stay up-to-date and check out past updates in our going <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2015/02/12/campus-2-construction-progress-timeline/\"><span class=\"s2\">Campus 2 construction progress timeline</span></a>. </span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Jordan Kahn", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/04/new-apple-campus-2-flyover-for-april-shows-progress-on-the-spaceship-over-the-last-year/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/b6lmfjpf", "title": "New Apple Campus 2 flyover for April shows progress on the spaceship over the last year", "excerpt": "Following a flyover video late last month, today we get even newer 4K footage of Apple&#x2019;s under construction Campus 2 site for April courtesy of YouTuber Duncan Sinfield.
