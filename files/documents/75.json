{"content": "<div><div class=\"post-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Tim Cook&#x2019;s pitch for the fourth generation Apple TV so far has been largely that &#x201C;the future of TV is apps&#x201D;, and this week yet another premium cable and satellite network is launching a standalone version of its network for cord cutters. Starz, which before now has required a traditional cable or satellite package for access, is <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/starz-launches-standalone-streaming-service-880798\" target=\"_blank\">launching a streaming version of its network</a> for a monthly rate competitive to HBO and Netflix. The <a href=\"https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/starz/id550221096?mt=8&amp;at=10laZc&amp;ct=925\" target=\"_blank\">new Starz app</a> is available on iPhone, iPad, and the fourth generation&#xA0;Apple TV for $8.99/month if you don&#x2019;t have the network in your cable package. Also in the streaming space, we learned today that Twitter has emerged victorious is scoring the rights to stream 10 NFL &#x201C;Thursday Night Football&#x201D; games in the next season&#x2026;</p>\n\n<p>Variety <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/twitter-nfl-thursday-night-football-streaming-1201745869/\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Twitter will carry the 10 &#x201C;Thursday Night Football&#x201D; games broadcast by NBC and CBS, which will also be simulcast on NFL Network.</p>\n<p>Twitter will provide free, live streaming video of &#x201C;Thursday Night Football&#x201D; without authentication on mobile phones, tablets, PCs and connected TVs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If that marriage between the NFL and Twitter, a social network, seems strange, just remember&#xA0;that Apple was&#xA0;very <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/04/apple-streaming-nfl-games/\" target=\"_blank\">recently said to be in talks</a> to win those streaming rights for themselves, although it was <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/03/nfl-streaming-on-apple/\" target=\"_blank\">reported last month</a> that Apple dropped out of the negotiations.</p>\n<p>And although it&#x2019;s not an exclusive deal, the new standalone Starz streaming service does add yet another network to Apple&#x2019;s iOS and tvOS platform for iPhone, iPad, and the new Apple TV, which means even without an Apple-provided entertainment package, customers will have even more content without going through the cable company.</p>\n<p>The $8.99/month Starz package uses the same app that cable subscribers use, unlike HBO NOW and HBO GO; and not only lets subscribers stream&#xA0;movies and TV shows like Ant-Man, Inside Out, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Party Down, but Starz customers can also download content for offline watching as well which few competitors (with the exception of&#xA0;Amazon Prime Video) offer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.speckproducts.com/apple/iphone-cases/iphone-5s-cases/candyshell-grip-iphone-5s-cases/IP5-CS-GRIP.html?utm_source=9to5mac.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=iPhone%20SE%20launch\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-425538\"><img title=\"Starz hits Apple TV with $8.99/month package, Twitter scores live NFL Thursday Night Football streams\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-425538\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/ad_clear_pecan_728x90.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"AD_Clear_Pecan_728x90\"></a></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Zac Hall", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/05/starz-standalone-package-apple-tv-twitter-nfl-streaming-deal/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/5w2fgwuq", "title": "Starz hits Apple TV with $8.99/month package, Twitter scores live NFL \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d streams", "excerpt": "Tim Cook&#x2019;s pitch for the fourth generation Apple TV so far has been largely that &#x201C;the future of TV is apps&#x201D;, and this week yet another premium cable and satellite network is&hellip;", "direction": "ltr", "word_count": 327, "total_pages": 0, "next_page_id": null, "dek": null, "lead_image_url": "https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/ad_clear_pecan_728x90.jpg?w=1000", "rendered_pages": 1, "date_published": "2016-04-05 14:12:38"}
