{"content": "<div><div class=\"post-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Since Apple Music was officially announced, Apple has had a deep partnership with rapper Drake, even bringing him on stage&#xA0;last year at WWDC to discuss Connect. Drake and Apple reportedly <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2015/05/31/drake-pharrell-williams-david-guetta-in-talks-to-be-djs-for-new-itunes-radio/\">inked a $19 million deal</a> to have the rapper host a show on Beats 1 among other things, and now, BuzzFeed News <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/brendanklinkenberg/drakes-new-album-will-only-be-exclusive-to-apple-music-for-t#.xmq188xe9\">reports</a> that Drake&#x2019;s highly anticipated new album &#x201C;Views From The 6&#x201D;&#xA0;will be an Apple Music exclusive when released on April 29th&#x2026;but only for a week.</p>\n\n<p>Drake&#x2019;s &#x201C;Views From The 6&#x201D; has been highly anticipated following the rapper&#x2019;s last release, &#x201C;If You&#x2019;re Reading This It&#x2019;s Too Late&#x201D; with Future. That mixtape, released last February, was a smash success in terms of streaming, setting records on Apple Music-rival Spotify.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s interesting, however, that the exclusive window for &#x201C;Views From The 6&#x201D; is so short for Apple Music considering the company&#x2019;s strong relationship with Drake. From his perspective, however, Drake has every reason in the world to try and make the album as available as possible. Kanye West, for instance, <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/15/kanye-west-continues-bizarre-twitter-tirade-says-his-new-album-will-never-be-on-apple-music/\">limited the availability of his latest album &#x201C;The Life of Pablo&#x201D;</a> to Tidal at first release and saw a variety of consequences, including increased piracy and a lack of revenue. Despite saying he would never do it though, West has <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/31/kanye-west-tlop-apple-music/\">since released the album on other streaming services, including Apple Music.</a></p>\n<p>Drake&#x2019;s most <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/01/taylor-swift-apple-music-ad/\">recent move with Apple came with the use of his and Future&#x2019;s song &#x201C;Jumpman&#x201D; in an Apple Music ad starring Taylor Swift</a>. The ad <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/drake-s-itunes-sales-shot-431-percent-after-taylor-swifts-memorable-apple-music-ad-170623\">reportedly</a> drove sales of Drake&#x2019;s music up over 400 percent in iTunes.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve long <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2015/07/06/review-apple-music-offers-great-discovery-radio-features-but-has-room-for-improvement/\">argued that exclusive content is what&#x2019;s going to set Apple Music apart from the competition</a>, and despite the fact that it&#x2019;s only exclusive for a week, Apple securing the rights to &#x201C;Views From The 6&#x201D; is a huge step in that direction. An album as highly-anticipated as Drake&#x2019;s will likely drive users of other streaming services to at least sign up for the free Apple Music trial, and those users could potentially turn in to long-term users.</p>\n<p>Remember, his name is Drake and he thanks you for your time.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"704\" height=\"426\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/RFrlOS5SP3c?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;start=181&amp;wmode=transparent\"></iframe></span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Chance Miller", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/11/views-from-the-6-drake-availability-streaming/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/usjwrcgd", "title": "Drake\u2019s upcoming album \u2018Views From The 6\u2019 will be an Apple Music exclusive, but only for a week", "excerpt": "Since Apple Music was officially announced, Apple has had a deep partnership with rapper Drake, even bringing him on stage&#xA0;last year at WWDC to discuss Connect.
