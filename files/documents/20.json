Sources have told <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/dd/2016/04/07/google-facebook-uber-swift/\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>The Next Web</i></span></a> that Google is &#x201C;considering making Swift a &#x2018;first class&#x2019; language for Android&#x201D;.\n\n\t<ins class=\"adsbygoogle author_ad\"></ins>\n\n\t\t\n</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Google&#x2019;s mobile platform currently runs off of Java as its main language, and the inclusion of <a href=\"https://bit.ly/1RVV47M\"><span class=\"s2\">Swift</span></a> isn&#x2019;t seen as to replace Java initially. With Swift being open-source, Google could toy with Swift as it evolves to discover if it would even be a good fit for the Android platform, according to the report.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Some have speculated that an app written in Swift would then be able to run on both Android and iOS, although that isn&#x2019;t quite accurate. Android and iOS may share the same language in the future, but platform-specific API differences between the two means that apps on either won&#x2019;t magically run on the other. Though, it <i>would</i> make developing between both platforms easier in the sense that developers wouldn&#x2019;t have to develop across two different programming languages.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The report also notes that some low-level Android APIs are written in C++, something which Swift can&#x2019;t currently bridge too. This would require some finessing on Google&#x2019;s part to make compatible.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We&#x2019;ve seen some big players come out with support for Swift, most notably IBM with their <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/22/ibm-swift-cloud-kitura/\"><span class=\"s2\">Kitura framework</span></a>.</span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Greg Barbosa", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/08/google-considering-swift-android/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/lv2ktvbw", "title": "Google reportedly considering possibility of Swift as programming language for Android", "excerpt": "Apple&#x2019;s recently open-sourced programming language, Swift, may be seeing itself get adopted into Google&#x2019;s Android platform in the future.
