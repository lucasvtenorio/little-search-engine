{"content": "<div><div class=\"post-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>A very common complaint from&#xA0;iOS users&#xA0;is&#xA0;that unused stock apps cannot&#xA0;be hidden&#xA0;or removed from the Home screen, so &#x2018;less useful&#x2019; apps like Tips or Stocks have to be hidden in a folder somewhere to get them off the Home screen. <a href=\"http://appadvice.com/post/not-just-a-rumor-users-will-soon-be-able-to-remove-apples-stock-ios-apps/709986\">As noted by AppAdvice</a>,&#xA0;the internal App Store&#xA0;JSON&#xA0;data source has added a couple of new interesting keys&#xA0;in the last few weeks, which suggests that Apple is in fact adding&#xA0;the ability to hide stock&#xA0;apps soon &#x2026;</p>\n\n<p>The&#xA0;additions to the internal API include keys for &#x2018;isFirstParty&#x2019; and &#x2018;isFirstPartyHideableApp&#x2019;. In our testing, we could verify the existence of the boolean fields, but could only ever find them with a&#xA0;false value. This makes sense given that the App Store to date only hosts third-party apps offered as optional downloads.</p>\n<p>In a future OS release (iOS 10?), this discovery suggests that at least some stock Apple apps will be&#xA0;hideable in some way. Perhaps core features like the Phone or Messages app will remain mandatory, but presumably apps like Compass or Calculator would be user&#xA0;removable. Tim Cook <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2015/09/15/tim-cook-interview-siri-iphone-6s-default-apps/\">hinted at something like this</a> in an interview with Buzzfeed back in September.</p>\n<p><img title=\"iTunes metadata suggests ability to hide stock apps on iPhone and iPad coming soon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-426405\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/screenshot-2016-04-04-11-03-13-2_f237c350b8ba52a027e3e6f1232f0a98-m.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"Screenshot-2016-04-04-11.03.13-2_f237c350b8ba52a027e3e6f1232f0a98-m\"></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the iTunes metadata leak cannot reveal any info about how Apple plans to use these keys.&#xA0;Speculating, it could mean that Apple stock apps will start being listed in the App Store. For example, if&#xA0;a user hid&#xA0;the Stocks app but later decided they wanted to restore its position on their Home Screen, they would visit the App Store and re-download the app&#xA0;&#x2026; mirroring the&#xA0;experience for&#xA0;third-party apps.</p>\n<p>It may also mean that stock apps could&#xA0;become less dependent on the system OS, potentially&#xA0;allowing Apple to push updates to stock apps via the App Store rather than waiting for the next&#xA0;major&#xA0;system software updates.</p>\n<p>There&#x2019;s also the possibility that these internal keys are meant for a different purpose,&#xA0;although it&#x2019;s hard to imagine&#xA0;what else that could be. A name like &#x2018;isFirstPartyAppHideable&#x2019; is rather unambiguous,&#xA0;however, at having something to do with hiding first party apps, so it&#x2019;s hard to consider&#xA0;any realistic alternative uses. There&#x2019;s also a chance that although Apple is working on&#xA0;the feature internally, it decides never to ship it&#xA0;to customers publicly.</p>\n<p>Right now, the only way to hide some stock apps is&#xA0;by connecting an iPhone or iPad to a&#xA0;Mac and use the (enterprise) Apple Configurator tool to setup a custom Home screen&#xA0;profile. Perhaps with iOS 10, Apple will finally make this feature available to general customers right from&#xA0;iOS itself.&#xA0;A lot of users have certainly been voicing their support for&#xA0;such a feature for a while.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Benjamin Mayo", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/06/hiding-stock-iphone-ipad-apps/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/uacxmiau", "title": "iTunes metadata suggests ability to hide stock apps on iPhone and iPad coming soon", "excerpt": "A very common complaint from&#xA0;iOS users&#xA0;is&#xA0;that unused stock apps cannot&#xA0;be hidden&#xA0;or removed from the Home screen, so &#x2018;less useful&#x2019; apps like Tips or Stocks&hellip;", "direction": "ltr", "word_count": 411, "total_pages": 0, "next_page_id": null, "dek": null, "lead_image_url": "https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/screenshot-2016-04-04-11-03-13-2_f237c350b8ba52a027e3e6f1232f0a98-m.jpg?w=1000", "rendered_pages": 1, "date_published": "2016-04-06 15:17:18"}
