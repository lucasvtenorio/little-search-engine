{"content": "<div><div class=\"post-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Back in November of last year, Re/code&#x2019;s Mark Bergen <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2015/11/30/alphabets-access-rebrand-fiber-titan/\">profiled</a> Google&#x2019;s/Alphabet&#x2019;s &#x2018;Access and Energy&#x2019; group, which includes a lot of projects and products focused on helping bring people online. Of course Google Fiber falls into this category, but so does&#xA0;<a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/project-link\">Project Link</a>, a&#xA0;<a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/railtel\">RailTel</a> partnership,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/project-sunroof\">Project Sunroof</a>,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/project-titan\">Project Titan</a>, as well as&#xA0;the consumer <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/onhub\">OnHub</a> router product. Now, the recently updated&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdemike\">LinkedIn profile</a> of Global Operations&#xA0;head Joe DeMike at the Alphabet group might&#xA0;have accidentally revealed the name of another product: Accelerator&#x2026;</p>\n\n<p>First, let&#x2019;s rule out some other similarly-named products/projects at the Mountain View company. Based on some quick research&#xA0;it&#x2019;s definitely not the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/startups/accelerator/\">Google Developers Launchpad Accelerator</a>&#xA0;(which gives app developers training and resources to fast-track their ideas) nor the <a href=\"https://accelerate.withgoogle.com/\">Accelerate with Google</a>&#xA0;program (which helps grow your business), and certainly not the ancient <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Accelerator\">Google Web Accelerator</a> (which was a small piece of&#xA0;software you installed on your computer that worked with Google&#x2019;s caching servers to speed up&#xA0;load times in the dial-up days of the web).</p>\n<p>I think we can also obviously rule out the <a href=\"https://www.ampproject.org/\">&#x201C;Accelerated Mobile Pages&#x201D;</a> project, as DeMike&#x2019;s profile says that he&#x2019;s a &#x201C;key leader in Google&#x2019;s efforts to bring the internet to everyone,&#x201D; not leading a team to make the web faster for those who read sites like this.</p>\n<p>There are lots of projects at Google that involve &#x2018;accelerating&#x2019; a lot of different things, but not many of them seem to fit this &#x201C;Accelerator&#x201D; project at Google Access. So what is it?</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s possible that this is simply a&#xA0;rename, regroup, or a new name of an already-existing product. It&#x2019;s not uncommon for Google to rename projects (think Google Glass -&gt; Project Aura), and there are plenty of projects that Google is working on in the realm of &#x2018;accelerating&#x2019; the web for the next billion. A perfect recent example was President <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/03/21/obama-google-internet-cuba/\">Barack Obama&#x2019;s comments about Google planning to help bring more internet access to an internet-deprived Cuba</a>. That sounds more like a Project Link, Project Loon, or a Google Fiber project to me, but maybe it&#x2019;s something new. To me &#x201C;Accelerator&#x201D; sounds more like a product for making the web faster in areas that already have a connection, though &#x2014; not building infrastructure for the connection itself.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/aaeaaqaaaaaaaaioaaaajdjhytg3ngrjltu0m2ytndhhos04zgjlltuym2yxndiwztmxnw.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-138011\"><img title=\"Google's Access group, which includes Fiber, is working on a new product called 'Accelerator'\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-138011\" src=\"https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/aaeaaqaaaaaaaaioaaaajdjhytg3ngrjltu0m2ytndhhos04zgjlltuym2yxndiwztmxnw.jpg?w=325&amp;h=325\" alt=\"AAEAAQAAAAAAAAIoAAAAJDJhYTg3NGRjLTU0M2YtNDhhOS04ZGJlLTUyM2YxNDIwZTMxNw\" width=\"325\"></a>As DeMike&#x2019;s profile says, he&#x2019;s &#x201C;responsible for launching the exciting new Accelerator product to countries around the world.&#x201D; While this doesn&#x2019;t give us much of an idea of what exactly Accelerator is, it does tell us <em>something</em>.&#xA0;Much like the Access group&#x2019;s Project Link, Accelerator involves the entire world, probably connected to Google&#x2019;s long term vision of reaching the &#x201C;next billion&#x201D; users. Besides Link (which is bringing Fiber to emerging markets), Google&#x2019;s also trying to reach these users by way of <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/android-one\">Android One</a>, <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/project-loon\">Project Loon</a>, <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/project-titan\">Project Titan</a>, <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2015/09/04/report-google-planning-to-reenter-china-w-special-play-store-android-wear-support-more/\">plans to reenter China</a>, and more initiatives.</p>\n<p>But what about the RailTel deal?</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Accelerator&#x201D; might be the name for the umbrella of projects that include the RailTel partnership that brought&#xA0;<a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/01/22/google-wi-fi-mumbai-central/\">free high-speed Wi-Fi network in Mumbai Central&#xA0;station</a>.&#xA0;Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed plans for the company&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2015/12/16/google-in-app-translations-india/\" target=\"_blank\">renewed focus on India</a>. As we reported, part of that plan is ensuring that India can get access to&#xA0;high-speed internet, especially when traveling on the nation&#x2019;s rail services. Sundar Pichai <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2015/12/16/google-in-app-translations-india/\">said in December of last year</a> that it&#xA0;will be offering WiFi at 100 train stations in the country next year, starting with Mumbai Central in early January. A further 300 stations will follow. That&#x2019;s a huge project, and I think it needs a name beyond just &#x201C;RailTel partnership&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>The second thing that DeMike&#x2019;s LinkedIn profile&#xA0;tells us is that Accelerator is a product. Based on the most traditional definition of the word, I would put something like Android One or Google Fiber under the definition of a &#x201C;product,&#x201D; but not necessarily Project Titan.&#xA0;Initially, the RailTel deal is bringing free service, but Pichai said that Google does have plans to make it self-sustainable at some point &#x2014; they will likely begin charging for the service in the future in order to cover the costs of the project.</p>\n<p>Google was&#xA0;<a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/01/22/google-wi-fi-mumbai-central/\">reluctant earlier this year</a> to give a figure on exactly how fast this network is, but the company said at the time that it&#x2019;s fast enough to stream an HD movie, which is faster than the internet speeds found in almost all households in India.</p>\n<p>As I said, it&#x2019;s also entirely possible that I&#x2019;m completely wrong and that Accelerator is something entirely new. Hopefully we&#x2019;ll know soon.</p>\n<p>We&#x2019;ve reached out, but Google was not available for comment at the time of this writing. We&#x2019;ll update this article if/when Google clarifies the situation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/final-blog-post-image.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-138001\"><img title=\"Google's Access group, which includes Fiber, is working on a new product called 'Accelerator'\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-138001\" src=\"https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/final-blog-post-image.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"final-blog-post-image\"></a></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Stephen Hall", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/07/googles-access-group-accelerator/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/pgsl6tj7", "title": "Google\u2019s Access group, which includes Fiber, is working on a new product called \u2018Accelerator\u2019", "excerpt": "Back in November of last year, Re/code&#x2019;s Mark Bergen profiled Google&#x2019;s/Alphabet&#x2019;s &#x2018;Access and Energy&#x2019; group, which includes a lot of projects and products focused&hellip;", "direction": "ltr", "word_count": 748, "total_pages": 0, "next_page_id": null, "dek": null, "lead_image_url": "https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/aaeaaqaaaaaaaaioaaaajdjhytg3ngrjltu0m2ytndhhos04zgjlltuym2yxndiwztmxnw.jpg?w=325&h=325", "rendered_pages": 1, "date_published": "2016-04-07 17:57:16"}
