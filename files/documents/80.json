{"content": "<div><div class=\"post-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>A new iPhone 6s/6s Plus passcode&#xA0;bypass flaw is making its rounds on&#xA0;the internet today, and it&#x2019;s similar to flaws we&#x2019;ve seen in the past on iOS. Don&#x2019;t be overly alarmed, though, as the odds of this happening to you are&#xA0;slim. Besides, if you are concerned, there are some bonafide ways to go about protecting yourself.\n\t<ins class=\"adsbygoogle author_ad\"></ins>\n\n\t\t\n</p>\n<p>The bypass&#xA0;only works on the&#xA0;iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, because those devices feature 3D Touch, which is a requirement for this passcode bypass trick. Lesser devices don&#x2019;t appear to be affected, because a long press doesn&#x2019;t have the same effect as a 3D Touch.</p>\n<h3>Here&#x2019;s how to test the passcode&#xA0;bypass</h3>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Lock your device.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Invoke Siri and say &#x201C;Search Twitter&#x201D;.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once Siri asks what to search for, say: &#x201C;at-sign yahoo dot com&#x201D; or any other popular email domain. The goal is to find a tweet containing a valid email address.</p>\n<p><img title=\"New iPhone 6s passcode bypass lets users access Photos and Contacts; here's how to protect yourself\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-426188\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/bypass-passcode-siri-twitter.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=294\" alt=\"Bypass passcode siri twitter\" width=\"1000\"></p>\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once the search results are returned, tap on a tweet with a valid email address.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> 3D Touch the email address to bring up the contextual menu.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Tap Create New Contact &#x2192;&#xA0;add photo in order to view the photos on device. You can also view contacts on device by use the Add to Existing Contact option instead.</p>\n<h2>How to protect yourself</h2>\n<h3>Protect photos</h3>\n<p><img title=\"New iPhone 6s passcode bypass lets users access Photos and Contacts; here's how to protect yourself\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-426192\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/protect-photos-siri.png?w=1000&amp;h=590\" alt=\"Protect photos Siri\" width=\"1000\"></p>\n<p>You can disable Siri&#xA0;access to photos, which will prevent people from using the&#xA0;Create New Contact &#x2192;&#xA0;add photo option mentioned above in step 6. To do so, go to <strong>Settings</strong>&#xA0;&#x2192; <strong>Privacy</strong>&#xA0;&#x2192; <strong>Photos</strong>&#xA0;and disable the&#xA0;<strong>Siri</strong> switch. Unfortunately, this won&#x2019;t prevent people from seeing your contacts, so if this is a concern, see the alternative security method below.</p>\n<h3>Disable Siri on the Lock screen</h3>\n<p><img title=\"New iPhone 6s passcode bypass lets users access Photos and Contacts; here's how to protect yourself\" class=\"wp-image-426191 aligncenter\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/disable-siri-on-lock-screen1.png?w=620&amp;h=549\" alt=\"Disable Siri on Lock screen\" width=\"620\"></p>\n<p>You can outright disable access to Siri from the Lock screen, stopping this passcode bypass method before it even begins. To do so, go to <strong>Settings</strong>&#xA0;&#x2192; <strong>Touch ID &amp; Passcode</strong> and disable the <strong>Siri</strong> switch under the <em>allow access when locked</em> heading. This is the more drastic step that eliminates the ability to use Siri altogether&#xA0;while at the Lock screen, so understand the consequences that this could have on your workflow.</p>\n<p>You can also rest easy knowing that if your iPhone reboots or encounters a Touch ID grace period time out, you&#x2019;ll need to verify your passcode before using Siri. Chances are, you&#x2019;ll never have to worry about your privacy being breached by means of this bypass. That said, you should be aware that such a thing exists, and more importantly, how to go about protecting yourself should the need arise.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Jeff Benjamin", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/04/new-iphone-6s-passcode-bypass-access-photos-contacts-how-to-protect-yourself/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/uxtgpexv", "title": "New iPhone 6s passcode bypass lets users access Photos and Contacts; here\u2019s how to protect yourself", "excerpt": "A new iPhone 6s/6s Plus passcode&#xA0;bypass flaw is making its rounds on&#xA0;the internet today, and it&#x2019;s similar to flaws we&#x2019;ve seen in the past on iOS.
