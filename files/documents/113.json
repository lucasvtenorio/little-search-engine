While subscribers could opt to pay $25 per month for 12 months to cover the $300 installation fee, internet usage was completely free. There was one caveat however: Download speeds were limited to just 5Mbps. Now, Google <a href=\"http://recode.net/2016/04/09/free-google-fiber-kansas-city/\" target=\"_blank\">has replaced this</a> Basic Tier with a 100Mbps plan and rebranded its two other tiers.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/google-fiber\" target=\"_blank\">Google Fiber</a>&#x2018;s offerings in Kansas City now include Fiber 100, Fiber 1000 and Fiber 1000 + TV. Fiber 100 costs $50 per month and includes unlimited data use with 100Mbps upload and download speeds. Like the other two plans, the installation fee (now down to $100) is waived with a 12 month agreement. This replaces the free tier which had 5Mbps downloads and 1Mbps uploads, and a $300 installation fee.</p>\n<p>While the name has changed to Fiber 100, the middle tier plan has remained virtually unchanged. It costs $70 per month and includes up to 1000Mbps upload and download speeds as well as 1TB Google Drive cloud storage. The $130 Fiber 1000 + TV tier offers the same, plus access to 150+ channels and the ability to record up to 8 shows at once.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s an interesting move by Google. While some may bemoan the removal of a free tier, there&#x2019;s no doubt that a 100Mbps plan will offer a much better experience to subscribers than the old 5Mbps plan ever would. It will also undoubtedly help Alphabet&#x2019;s Fiber brand start becoming its own sustainable, money-making business. Tied to the recent <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/03/29/google-fiber-phone/\" target=\"_blank\">arrival of its landline service</a>, Google Fiber is slowly turning in to a proper telecoms provider.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\"> <div class=\"gallery-row\"> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\"> <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-large\"> <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/04/09/google-fiber-drops-free-plan-kansas-city/screen-shot-2016-04-09-at-23-00-03/\" border=\"0\"> <img src=\"https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-09-at-23-00-03.png\" width=\"495\" title=\"Screen Shot 2016-04-09 at 23.00.03\" alt=\"Old Plans, included Basic Internet tier\"> </a> <p class=\"tiled-gallery-caption\"> Old Plans, included Basic Internet tier </p> </div> </div>  <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\"> <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-large\"> <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/04/09/google-fiber-drops-free-plan-kansas-city/screen-shot-2016-04-09-at-22-59-48/\" border=\"0\"> <img src=\"https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-09-at-22-59-48.png\" width=\"497\" title=\"Screen Shot 2016-04-09 at 22.59.48\" alt=\"New Fiber 100 and rebranded Fiber 1000 (&amp;TV) plans\"> </a> <p class=\"tiled-gallery-caption\"> New Fiber 100 and rebranded Fiber 1000 (&amp;TV) plans </p> </div> </div>  </div>  </div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Cam Bunton", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/09/google-fiber-drops-free-plan-kansas-city/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/agjl0i7n", "title": "Google Fiber drops its free basic tier in Kansas City, replaces with $50/m 100Mbps plan", "excerpt": "When Google Fiber first launched in Kansas City, it did so with the promise of free internet, as long as&#xA0;customers paid for their installation.
