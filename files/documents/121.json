The HTC 10 is going to have &#x2018;<a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/04/04/htc-working-on-the-best-boomsound-yet-for-its-upcoming-10-flagship/\" target=\"_blank\">the best BoomSound yet</a>&#x2018;, a &#x2018;<a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/02/25/htc-interview-camera-vive/\" target=\"_blank\">compelling camera</a>&#x2018;, and a shiny, polished <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/02/24/htc-one-m10-tease/\" target=\"_blank\">chamfer on the back</a>&#xA0;according to the manufacture&#x2019;s past tweets. Now Qualcomm has joined in with the pre-launch games&#x2026;</p>\n\n<p>Ahead of next week&#x2019;s online unveiling, Qualcomm <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Qualcomm/status/718106067905986564\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted an image</a> clearly indicating that its own Snapdragon chip will be powering HTC&#x2019;s next solid, all-metal flagship smartphone.</p>\n<p>Unless the company has developed a bespoke chip, optimized especially for HTC, we can safely&#xA0;assume that the chip inside the phone will be the <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/snapdragon-820\" target=\"_blank\">Snapdragon 820</a> processor. It is the SoC of choice for both Samsung and LG with their respective <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/galaxy-s7\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy S7</a> and <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/lg-g5\" target=\"_blank\">G5</a> lineups.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The power of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Snapdragon?src=hash\">#Snapdragon</a> meets the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/powerof10?src=hash\">#powerof10</a>. Are you ready for next week? <a href=\"https://t.co/Gkf8jkWat1\">pic.twitter.com/Gkf8jkWat1</a></p>\n<p>&#x2014; Qualcomm (@Qualcomm) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Qualcomm/status/718106067905986564\">April 7, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Unlike the Galaxy S7 and G5, however, HTC isn&#x2019;t hosting a major press event. Instead, it&#x2019;s streaming a <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/03/22/htc-10-online-only-april-12/\" target=\"_blank\">live online-only event</a> on April 12 at 8am Eastern time.</p>\n<p>Along with the Snapdragon 820 processor, HTC&#x2019;s next high-end device is expected to feature the trademark solid aluminum build and a 5.2-inch Quad HD display as well as&#xA0;a 12MP camera with dual-LED flash and laser autofocus. While it&#x2019;s going to feature &#x2018;the best BoomSound yet&#x2019;, it&#x2019;s not going to feature traditional front-firing speakers. We&#x2019;re expecting the audio hardware to be laid out a little differently.</p>\n<p>The big question here is whether or not the device can help it compete in an increasingly competitive market, with Samsung already having released one of the <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/03/17/galaxy-s7-edge-review/\" target=\"_blank\">best smartphones of all time</a>. More importantly, can the device stop HTC&#x2019;s financial free-fall? Revenue in Q1 of this year <a href=\"http://investors.htc.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=148697&amp;p=irol-reportsMonthlyRevenues\" target=\"_blank\">dropped a massive 64%</a> on the same quarter a year ago, and saw the Taiwanese company&#x2019;s quarterly revenue dip to just NT$41.5 million, or roughly&#xA0;$128 million US Dollars.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Cam Bunton", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/08/qualcomm-snapdragon-htc-10-teaser/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/t1t1jsjz", "title": "Qualcomm teases HTC 10 Snapdragon chip ahead of next week\u2019s launch", "excerpt": "HTC has been publishing its own revealing teasers for the upcoming flagship smartphone over the past few weeks.
