After several <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/01/14/android-studio-2-preview-5/\">previews</a>, <a href=\"http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2016/04/android-studio-2-0.html\">Android Studio 2.0</a> has finally been&#xA0;released to the stable channel.</p>\n\n<p>With Instant Run, developers can see changes they make&#xA0;to their app&#x2019;s code reflected near instantaneously on their device or in an emulator. Additionally, a brand new emulator has&#xA0;a refreshed&#xA0;interface that supports multi-touch gestures and new rotation controls. Google touts that the emulator runs 3x faster than the previous version and even some real devices.</p>\n<p>With Cloud Test Lab integration, developers can test their app virtually&#xA0;on a wide range of physical devices right from Android Studio.&#xA0;Other features include the ability to build in&#xA0;<a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2013/12/04/google-search-for-android-update-now-finds-information-inside-your-installed-apps/\">App Indexing</a>&#xA0;which promotes visibility in Search.&#xA0;Developers can now test and validate URL links from within the IDE.</p>\n<p>After upgrading, developers should upgrade their current project to use Instant Run and create a new Android Virtual Device to gain the benefits of the faster emulator. New projects started in version 2.0 will have Instant Run turned on by default.&#xA0;Google says they&#x2019;re already working on the next release. Along with the Android N Developer Preview, they&#xA0;released <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/03/09/google-releases-android-studio-2-1-preview-with-support-for-android-n/\">Android Studio 2.1</a> that supports developing for the upcoming OS version.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"704\" height=\"426\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc_w6fodMGrA1_tsI3pqPbqa&amp;hl=en_US\"></iframe></span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Abner Li", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/07/android-studio-2-stable-channel/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/xipkpnfd", "title": "Android Studio 2.0 now in stable channel w/ new emulator, Instant Run, and more", "excerpt": "At its&#xA0;inaugural Android Developer Summit in November, Google announced a new version&#xA0;of its app development IDE that features a new emulator, &#x2018;Instant Run&#x2019;, and more&#xA0;for&hellip;", "direction": "ltr", "word_count": 204, "total_pages": 0, "next_page_id": null, "dek": null, "lead_image_url": null, "rendered_pages": 1, "date_published": "2016-04-07 18:22:06"}
