Today, while these are&#xA0;features that have long been part of&#xA0;Gmail on the web and Android, an <a href=\"http://googleappsupdates.blogspot.com/2016/04/update-to-drive-plug-in-for-microsoft.html\">update</a>&#xA0;to the Drive&#xA0;plugin for&#xA0;Outlook will allow users to insert Drive documents into emails, save incoming attachments, and have access to other features found in Gmail.</p>\n\n<p>Users will be able to easily browse their Google Drive and insert a share link to any file in an email. Additionally, you&#xA0;can easily upload any local document&#xA0;from this interface&#xA0;and&#xA0;edit a file&#x2019;s sharing permissions. The plug-in will intelligently&#xA0;show a panel before sending an email to&#xA0;a recipient.</p>\n<p>Another feature making its way to Outlook is the ability to automatically save incoming attachments to Google Drive without the need to download the file and manually upload.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://tools.google.com/dlpage/driveforoffice\">updated plug-in</a> will be rolling out to all users within three days and supports the 2007, 2010, and 2013 Windows versions of Outlook.&#xA0;Office 365 subscribers who have downloaded Outlook will also be able to benefit from this plug-in.</p>\n<p>Lately, Google has been opening up&#xA0;features once limited&#xA0;to users of their tightly integrated services. Last month,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/02/17/gmailify-third-party-email/\">Gmailify</a> allowed users of Outlook and other third-party email provides&#xA0;to have access to Gmail features like filtering, inbox organization, and Google Now cards.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Updated plugin allows users to browse and insert Drive files from Microsoft Outlook\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-137869 size-large\" src=\"https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/update-sharing-permissions-directly-from-outlook.gif?w=1000&amp;h=605\" alt=\"Update sharing permissions directly from Outlook\" width=\"1000\"></p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Abner Li", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/06/microsoft-outlook-google-drive-plug-in/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/qib6li2s", "title": "Updated plugin allows users to browse and insert Drive files from Microsoft Outlook", "excerpt": "Last July, Google created&#xA0;a plugin that allowed Office users to open documents stored in Google Drive and automatically&#xA0;sync back edits.
