Now it&#x2019;s on sale, and we&#x2019;ve <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/01/iphone-se-diary-day-1-first-impressions/\" target=\"_blank\">run</a> a <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/31/iphone-6s-vs-iphone-se-isight-camera-comparison/\" target=\"_blank\">number</a> of <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/31/iphone-se-from-iphone-6s-plus-impressions/\" target=\"_blank\">hands-on</a> pieces with the more pocketable phone, and that number has <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/01/iphone-se-diary-day-1-first-impressions/\" target=\"_blank\">grown dramatically</a>, to 48%.</p>\n\n<p>Straight after launch, approaching 16% of readers told us they were planning to upgrade from an older 4-inch phone, while just 10% were set to switch from a larger iPhone. But the numbers on Friday were very different: 25% of 4-inch owners, and an amazing 23% of owners of larger iPhones.</p>\n<p>Some readers cited the size as the reason for the appeal of the SE.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I never wanted a large screen phone &#x2013; but Apple gave me no choice. Now, SE will replace my (six months old) 6S [&#x2026;]</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I&#x2019;m so excited about the SE. 3D Touch is nice but definitely not worth the awkwardness of using a larger phone.[&#x2026;]</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I&#x2019;m putting my money where my mouth is and bought this too after advocating for reasonably sized phones for a couple years now. Selling my 6s soon. Being able to walk down the street while carrying something in one hand and being able to write texts and emails is a welcoming feeling again.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While others share my preference for the classic design.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My first iPhone was a 5, and I have to agree it is the nicest design so far. Nothing bad at all about the 6, it is really quite nice, it just seems doesn&#x2019;t match up with the 5 or SE [&#x2026;]</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I&#xA0;<span class=\"s1\">love the 5S, it&#x2019;s the most beautiful iPhone design ever. The SE makes me really happy.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While for some the price was key.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Personally I&#x2019;d rather upgrade for a 6s, but for my budget, having almost the same specs for lots of bucks less is more important to me than screen size!</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>KGI <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/tag/iphone-se/\" target=\"_blank\">may not believe</a> the <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/28/iphone-se-preorders-china/\" target=\"_blank\">reported numbers</a> for iPhone pre-orders, but among our readership &#x2013; a demographic you&#x2019;d expect to largely want the very best in specs &#x2013; we&#x2019;re seeing a surprising amount of love for Apple&#x2019;s latest four-incher.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Ben Lovejoy", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/04/iphone-se-purchase-intent-polls/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/lddd5guh", "title": "9to5Mac readers warming to the iPhone SE \u2013 purchase intent almost doubles, from 26% to 48%", "excerpt": "The first time we ran a poll on the iPhone SE, just after launch, some 26% of you were planning to buy it.
