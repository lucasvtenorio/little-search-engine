The ability to turn on both features&#xA0;was already hidden and <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/22/how-to-use-night-shift-low-power-mode-at-the-same-time-ios-9-3/\">only possible by using Siri</a>, but the iOS 9.3.1 update made it so that Siri would disable one of them before enabling another.</p>\n<p>We&#x2019;ve found a workaround that once again allows you to use both modes at once. It&#x2019;s not as easy as it once was, but it&#x2019;s still fairly straightforward for those of you who desire to use Low Power Mode and Night Shift mode at the same time.\n\t<ins class=\"adsbygoogle author_ad\"></ins>\n\n\t\t\n</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enable Low Power Mode via Settings&#xA0;&#x2192; Battery</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Invoke Siri and ask to enable Night Shift.&#xA0;Siri will reply with the following: <em>In order to turn on Night Shift, I&#x2019;ll have to turn off Low Power Mode. Shall I continue?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Reply with a &#x201C;yes&#x201D; and before the response is confirmed, press the sleep button on your iPhone. You should then hear Siri&#x2019;s confirmation beep.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Unlock your iPhone, and if you timed the sleep button press&#xA0;correctly, you should see Low Power Mode and Night Shift enabled at the same time.</p>\n<h2>Video walkthrough</h2>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"704\" height=\"426\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/BHSnKsm8bSo?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Note that the Night Shift switch in both Control Center and Settings&#xA0;&#x2192; Display &amp; Brightness will both be greyed out. Despite this, it will be very evident that Night Shift is enabled by looking at the color temperature of the screen.</p>\n<p>As you can see from our video walkthrough, this trick definitely works, but you may have to give it a few tries&#xA0;to get the timing just right.
