In one&#xA0;case, Google has&#xA0;added an ex-Apple&#xA0;global supply manager for the iPhone and the Apple Watch to the self-driving car supply management team&#x2026;</p>\n\n<p id=\"name\" class=\"fn\">Daniel Munoz was at one point a global supply manager for the iPhone, according to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/munozdan\">his LinkedIn profile</a>, where he &#x201C;managed over $1B of equipment&#x201D; and managed &#x201C;enclosure component supply chain and development concurrently at 10+ Asia based vendors&#x201D;. He then went on to work on the Apple Watch team under the same title, assumably with similar responsibilities. He joined the Google self-driving car team last month, under the same title.</p>\n<p class=\"fn\">It appears, though, that&#xA0;bringing him in&#xA0;from Apple might not be&#xA0;surprising, as&#xA0;Head of Supply Chain Operations Tim Willis (who has been at the company since August of 2015) is also ex-Apple <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tkwillis\">according to his LinkedIn profile</a>. There, he was a director of&#xA0;iPhone, Watch, iPod, and accessories&#xA0;global supply management for over 6 years. Furthermore, the self-driving car supply team includes&#xA0;<span class=\"s1\">Manufacturing and Supply Chain Leader&#xA0;</span><span class=\"s1\">Mani Krishnamurthi as of April of 2014, also <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mani-krishnamurthi-8b427128\">previously a global supply manager at Apple</a>, where he worked on delivering enclosures for&#xA0;</span><span class=\"s1\">Mac Pro, Apple TV, and Airport products.</span><span class=\"fn\"><span class=\"full-name\" dir=\"auto\">Sameer Kshirsagar is also a global supply manager, but did not come from Apple.</span></span></p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\"> <div class=\"gallery-row\"> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\"> <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-large\"> <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/04/05/google-self-driving-car-apple-supply-manager-millions-of-iphones-and-watches/aaeaaqaaaaaaaapjaaaajgnjnddkogezlwzmntqtndvjos05ztqyltcxztqzotbkmdi1yg/\" border=\"0\"> <img src=\"https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/aaeaaqaaaaaaaapjaaaajgnjnddkogezlwzmntqtndvjos05ztqyltcxztqzotbkmdi1yg.jpg\" width=\"496\" title=\"AAEAAQAAAAAAAAPJAAAAJGNjNDdkOGEzLWZmNTQtNDVjOS05ZTQyLTcxZTQzOTBkMDI1Yg\" alt=\"Daniel Munoz\"> </a> <p class=\"tiled-gallery-caption\"> Daniel Munoz </p> </div> </div>  <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\"> <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-large\"> <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/04/05/google-self-driving-car-apple-supply-manager-millions-of-iphones-and-watches/3ef11b2/\" border=\"0\"> <img src=\"https://9to5google.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/3ef11b2.jpg\" width=\"496\" title=\"3ef11b2\" alt=\"Tim Willis\"> </a> <p class=\"tiled-gallery-caption\"> Tim Willis </p> </div> </div>  </div>  </div>\n<p class=\"fn\">What&#x2019;s so interesting about this growing team is that many of its members have experience with global supply management of consumer products that sold millions and billions, a stark contrast to the current state of the self-driving car project (which has just 54 cars across 3 states). Most recently, speaking at the California Public Utilities Commission in September of last year, Sarah Hunter, Head of Public&#xA0;Policy&#xA0;at the&#xA0;Google self-driving car project, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2015/09/13/google-mulling-plan-to-sell-cars-offers-brief-history-of-its-autonomous-car-project/#1de0ed8421ed\">said</a> that Google still doesn&#x2019;t even know how it&#x2019;s going to bring the car to market.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We haven&#x2019;t decided yet how we&#x2019;re going to bring this to market. Right now our engineers are trying to figure out the answers to all of the difficult questions&#x2026;how to make a car genuinely drive itself. Once we figure that out, we&#x2019;ll figure out how to bring it to market.&#xA0;Is it going to be something we manufacture at scale [or] sell to individuals [or] something that we own and operate as a service? We just don&#x2019;t know. How people want to use these vehicles is very difficult to predict.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hiring and continuing to bring in ex-supply managers for products like the iPhone, Mac, and the Apple Watch would perhaps suggest that Google is already eyeing mass market potential for the cars. That wouldn&#x2019;t be too much of a long shot, considering Tesla&#x2019;s all-electric Model 3 just managed to snag <a href=\"http://electrek.co/2016/04/03/tesla-model-3-reservations-timeline/\">276,000 reservations in only a few days</a>. Elon Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/715307847890903041\">says</a> that part 2 of the Model 3 unveil&#xA0;will &#x201C;take things to another level,&#x201D; and that could very possibly mean some sort of fully-autonomous or mostly-autonomous AutoPilot. That would put the Model 3 closer to direct&#xA0;competition with Google&#x2019;s car.</p>\n<p>Other transitions and hirings from last month include Sr. Software Engineer&#xA0;<span dir=\"auto\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/warren-craddock-8bb60a4\">Warren Craddock</a> who heads back to Google[x] after departing the Glass team in 2014 and a short stint in the Machine Intelligence group,&#xA0;Lead CAD Specialist <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/albert-shane-8971965\">Albert Shane </a>who moved over from Nest (<a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/03/24/dropcams-founder-says-that-tony-fadell-runs-nest-like-a-tyrant-bureaucrat/\">which has been in turmoil lately</a>), and surely many others.
