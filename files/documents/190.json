{"content": "<div><div class=\"post-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Things aren&#x2019;t looking good for Nest. We told you last week about&#xA0;fallout happening&#xA0;within Alphabet&#x2019;s smart home products maker, including the <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/03/24/dropcams-founder-says-that-tony-fadell-runs-nest-like-a-tyrant-bureaucrat/\">departure of Dropcam&#x2019;s former CEO Greg Duffy and 50 of his former employees</a>, and now the story continues. According to a <a href=\"http://recode.net/2016/04/01/nest-vp-shige-honjo-departs/\">report</a> from Re/code, citing multiple sources, Nest has now lost its director of&#xA0;hardware&#xA0;design and engineering Shige Honjo as well&#xA0;Scott Mullins, a senior engineering manager&#x2026;</p>\n\n<p>Of the two departures, Honjo&#x2019;s is particularly noteworthy. He was the company&#x2019;s second employee and departed Apple to help start the company with Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers in 2010. Now, he&#x2019;s reportedly headed out by the end of next month.</p>\n<p>Mark Bergen has it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Honjo, the&#xA0;director of&#xA0;hardware&#xA0;design and engineering, will depart at the end of May. Mullins is shifting over to Google to work on the next iteration of its Glass wearable,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://recode.net/2015/09/16/no-more-glassholes-at-google-its-now-project-aura/\">dubbed Project Aura internally</a>. (He&#x2019;ll continue to work for&#xA0;Nest CEO Tony Fadell, who runs Aura independently of Nest.)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Mullins&#x2019; departure is also of note, but he&#x2019;s staying with Alphabet at <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/project-aura/\">Aura</a> &#x2014; and really, he&#x2019;s staying with Fadell. Project Aura is the group that has formed in the wake of Google Glass, working on an Enterprise Edition of the device that <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2015/12/28/this-is-google-glass-enterprise-edition-in-the-flesh-gallery/\">we&#x2019;ve told you about</a> before&#xA0;as well as two head-mounted audio-based devices. Project Aura is also one of the four companies I told you <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/03/31/opinion-google-four-projects-io-2016/\">I want to hear Google talk more about come Google I/O</a> (however likely that may be).</p>\n<p>Thanks to various reports over the last couple of weeks, Nest hasn&#x2019;t been getting the greatest PR. Besides the internal leaderships strife, the company is also under-performing and its <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/03/30/nest-future-lose-funding-fadell/\">future at Google is looking shaky</a>. The company generated $340 million in sales last year, and while that&#x2019;s&#xA0;not shabby considering that it&#x2019;s a&#xA0;company focused mainly on internet-connected thermostats, it&#x2019;s not as healthy as Google would like.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: Honjo&#x2019;s position at Nest changed since the <a href=\"https://nest.com/blog/2013/01/14/tom-vonreichbauer-and-shige-honjo-join-exec-team/\">most recent available information</a>. Nest reached out to say that Honjo is not an executive but rather Nest&#x2019;s director of hardware design and engineering. Nest says that&#xA0;he only held that title&#xA0;prior to the Google acquisition.
