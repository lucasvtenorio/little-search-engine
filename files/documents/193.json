While many other manufacturers have already rolled out Android 6.0 to their customers, it seems <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/blackberry-priv\" target=\"_blank\">BlackBerry PRIV</a> owners will need to wait at least another month.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a BlackBerry PRIV, you&#x2019;ll be waiting until at least the end of this month before Marshmallow starts making its way to your smartphone. The update could arrive as late as May.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">BlackBerry CEO says Android M update coming to Priv in late April/early May. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BBRY&amp;src=ctag\">$BBRY</a></p>\n<p>&#x2014; Roger Cheng (@RogerWCheng) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RogerWCheng/status/715874090964422656\">April 1, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>While it&#x2019;s disappointing that BlackBerry hasn&#x2019;t managed to get the Marshmallow update ready for launch yet, I still think the company&#x2019;s custom software makes up for that somewhat. Unlike other Android OEMs, its additional UIs and features serve a purpose and <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/02/08/blackberry-priv-software-feature/\" target=\"_blank\">make Android better</a> in some regards.</p>\n<p>Features like the Hub for managing notifications and schedules, and the Galaxy Edge-like extra features for quick actions on the right edge of the screen are super useful in day-to-day use. The software keyboard <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/02/05/blackberry-priv-keyboard/\" target=\"_blank\">isn&#x2019;t bad either</a>.</p>\n<p>With Marshmallow onboard, it&#x2019;ll be interesting to see if <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/blackberry\" target=\"_blank\">BlackBerry</a> tweaks and improves its customer software. Perhaps more interesting will be whether or not the company will opt to make use of the platform&#x2019;s ability to <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2015/12/16/android-6-marhsmallow-tip-adopt-microsd-card-internal-storage/\" target=\"_blank\">adopt MicroSD card storage</a> as internal memory, or whether it will <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/02/24/samsung-galaxy-s7-lg-g5-adoptable-storage/\" target=\"_blank\">join LG and Samsung</a> is rebuffing it.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"704\" height=\"426\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/hwAuFvxP8W4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\"></iframe></span></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Cam Bunton", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/01/android-marshmallow-blackberry-priv/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/hhcglyr1", "title": "Android Marshmallow update for BlackBerry PRIV rolling out in late April/early May", "excerpt": "During its fourth quarter earnings call this morning, John Chen, BlackBerry&#x2019;s CEO, confirmed when we can expect Android Marshmallow to land on&#xA0;its first Google-powered smartphone.
