As the name suggests, this is a band rather than a smartwatch &#x2014; pretty close in form factor to the <a href=\"http://9to5toys.com/2016/03/29/fitbit-alta-review/\">Fitbit Alta</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The device will sport many of the functions you&#x2019;ve come to know from similar devices from companies like Fitbit, including support for smart features like phone notifications, as well as activity tracking, sleep tracking, and more. The device has a&#xA0;PMOLED&#xA0;display at 80&#xD7;128 resolution protected by Gorilla Glass, and of course has a &#x201C;superb&#x201D;&#xA0;91mAh&#xA0;battery that charges in&#xA0;1.5&#xA0;hours and provides&#xA0;up&#xA0;to four days of typical use.</p>\n<p>There are three models of the TalkBand B3. There&#x2019;s the &#x201C;Active&#x201D; model which comes in white and black and ships for&#xA0;&#x20AC;169, a &#x201C;Classic&#x201D; model that comes in beige and brown for&#xA0;&#x20AC;199, and an &#x201C;Elite&#x201D; model that comes in titanium and gray colors for&#xA0;&#x20AC;249. Availability info should be coming soon, but like the P9 and P9 Plus, it&#x2019;s not likely that it will be available in the United States.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Stephen Hall", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/06/huawei-unveils-the-talkband-b3-wearable/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/ijlkzxg0", "title": "Huawei unveils the TalkBand B3 wearable", "excerpt": "Alongside its two new flagship phones, Huawei this morning also announced the TalkBand&#xA0;B3, a wearable device that sports both productivity and fitness features in what looks to be a pretty&hellip;", "direction": "ltr", "word_count": 184, "total_pages": 0, "next_page_id": null, "dek": null, "lead_image_url": null, "rendered_pages": 1, "date_published": "2016-04-06 15:47:44"}
