The EPA had some major pushback on the plan, so now Apple and the others are lending their support:</span></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&#x2026;Tech Amici&#x2019;s experience indicates that the Clean Power Plan reflects reasonable and attainable assumptions about the increasing availability of renewable generation in the nation&#x2019;s power sector&#x2026; Because the Clean Power Plan reflects reasonable expectations about the operations of the electricity market and the increasing use of renewable energy, Tech Amici submit this brief in support of the Plan. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Apple&#x2019;s environmental efforts are notably led by its&#xA0;</span><span class=\"s1\">Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson, who happens to be&#xA0;former Administrator of the EPA after <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2013/05/28/former-epa-administrator-lisa-jackson-to-join-apple/\" target=\"_blank\">leaving to join&#xA0;Apple in 2013</a>. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In the brief, the companies gave the following three main arguments to outline their support for the EPA&#x2019;s plan.
