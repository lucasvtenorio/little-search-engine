Save for screen sizes larger than 5-inches and a fingerprint sensor, not much is known about the flagship. HelloMotoHK, a leakster who <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2015/08/27/moto-360l-360s-leak/\">showed us</a>&#xA0;the first photos of the 2nd-generation Moto 360, has&#xA0;now&#xA0;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+hellomotoHK/posts/F8BhNFa4GAi\">posted a picture</a> of what appears to be an upcoming phone&#x2026;</p>\n\n<p>We can tell it&#x2019;s a Moto device from the &#x2018;batwing&#x2019; logo in the upper left corner used to denote <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2014/09/24/exclusive-this-is-shamu-motorolas-upcoming-nexus-6x/\">unreleased hardware</a>. The face&#xA0;of the device&#xA0;appears to have a squarish front fingerprint sensor near the bottom of the screen. Similar to <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2015/10/28/review-chasing-apple-teaches-htc-to-trim-down-with-very-usable-one-a9/\">HTC&#x2019;s approach</a>, it comes at the expense of the dual front-facing speakers that previous Moto X devices are known for. We can also see a port at the bottom, but the image is too blurry to discern whether it is USB Type-C.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2015/12/16/leaked-moto-x-prototype/\">rumor</a> late last year showed a Moto X prototype dummy that had a flat metal back with no fingerprint sensor. While that rumor was particularly sketchy, it would somewhat corroborate the above image. Furthermore, we can see in the current leak that the device has rather prominent metal&#xA0;edges.</p>\n<p>Specs for the Moto X have yet to leak, but a device that could possibly be the next generation Moto E leaked <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/04/04/moto-e-3rd-gen-by-lenovo-benchmarks/\">earlier this week</a>. A launch of the next generation Moto devices could come sooner than later&#xA0;as those devices recently hit an Indian import/export site.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Abner Li", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/07/moto-x-leaked-image/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/pfd3demu", "title": "Possible Moto X revealed in leaked image, front fingerprint sensor in place of dual speakers", "excerpt": "According to the Wall Street Journal, Lenovo is going to release its first device under the &#x2018;Moto&#x2019; brand in July.
