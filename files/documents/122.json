Likewise, Dutch Samsung blog, <em>GalaxyClub</em> <a href=\"http://www.galaxyclub.nl/2016/04/marshmallow-update-arriveert-in-europa-op-galaxy-note-4-sm-n910c/\" target=\"_blank\">corroborates those reports</a>. The update apparently weighs in at a hefty 1.3GB and brings the software up to version 6.0.1. What&#x2019;s more, it comes with the April Android security patch&#xA0;which was only released by Google <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/04/04/android-april-security-patch/\" target=\"_blank\">a few days ago</a>.</p>\n<p>As previous rumors suggested, the Marshmallow update brings with it some features across from the <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/tag/galaxy-note-5\" target=\"_blank\">Galaxy Note 5</a>. Most notably, Note 4 users will be able to take notes on the lock screen while it&#x2019;s in standby. Other updates, as usual, include the &#x2018;Doze&#x2019; standby power-saving feature and more granular app permission controls. There&#x2019;s no mention of whether or not Samsung included the ability to <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2015/12/16/android-6-marhsmallow-tip-adopt-microsd-card-internal-storage/\" target=\"_blank\">&#x2018;adopt&#x2019; MicroSD cards</a> as internal storage, but we&#x2019;re presuming &#x2014; given its <a href=\"http://9to5google.com/2016/02/24/samsung-galaxy-s7-lg-g5-adoptable-storage/\" target=\"_blank\">stance with the S7</a> &#x2014; it won&#x2019;t be featured in any of its phones.</p>\n<p>While Sprint has already pushed out the software to its own Note 4 users, we&#x2019;re yet to see Marshmallow become available on any of the other US carriers. We&#x2019;d like to imagine that this means it won&#x2019;t be long before Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&amp;T follow suit, but we&#x2019;ve been around long enough to know that some of the network providers like to drag their heels a little. As an example, T-Mo&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=65ec2173c03f9597f7d88a5deb613a1a&amp;type=bk&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.t-mobile.com%2Fcommunity%2Fphones-tablets-devices%2Fsoftware-updates%23tmoSUPDocTitle\" target=\"_blank\">software updates page</a> says the that the carrier&#xA0;has agreed to support the software update, but it hasn&#x2019;t progressed further in to testing as of yet.</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5google.com", "author": "Cam Bunton", "url": "http://9to5google.com/2016/04/08/android-marshmallow-update-for-galaxy-note-4-begins-international-rollout/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/fpfkmaf3", "title": "Android Marshmallow update for Samsung Galaxy Note 4 begins international rollout", "excerpt": "Months after early pre-release versions of the software allegedly appeared on some Galaxy Note 4 units, the official Android Marshmallow rollout has started.
