The playlist <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/apple-40/idpl.8fabcfe553684000856e2f0b5ed1ed8b?\">contains 38 songs in total</a>, with music from The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Coldplay, Gorillaz and more.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Apple turns 04. Forty songs from Apple ads to celebrate 40 years of&#xA0;ideas, innovation and culture.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately, the playlist has little accompanying context so you don&#x2019;t know which songs correspond to which ads. Most the songs appear to be derived from old iPod commercials, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoP3yWlh8fI\">like this one</a>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Can&#x2019;t Feel My Face</em> from The Weeknd is one of the most recent&#xA0;songs in the collection, which was used in a <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2015/08/31/apple-music-mtv-vma-the-weeknd/\">commercial for Apple Music during the Video Music Awards last year</a>.&#xA0;Readers interested in finding all the connections&#xA0;between the music listed and their origin in Apple advertising, should check <a href=\"http://www.applemusic.info\">out sites like&#xA0;AppleMusic.info</a>&#xA0;which document every song and artist&#xA0;Apple uses for its products and events.</p>\n<p>You&#x2019;ll need an <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/subscribe?at=10l3Qe&amp;ct=subscribe&amp;itscg=1002\">Apple Music subscription</a> to listen to these songs. Apple also commemorated its birthday by <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/01/apple-hangs-pirate-flag-over-infinite-loop-on-its-40th-birthday-2/\">hanging a pirate flag over its campus</a> on its 40th anniversary, as well as the following &#x2019;40 Years in 40 Seconds&#x2019; video.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"704\" height=\"426\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mtY0K2fiFOA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.speckproducts.com/apple/iphone-cases/iphone-5s-cases/candyshell-grip-iphone-5s-cases/IP5-...\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-425538\"><img title=\"Apple Music featuring commemorative anniversary playlist, songs from Apple ads over the last 40 years\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-425538\" src=\"https://9to5mac.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/ad_clear_pecan_728x90.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"AD_Clear_Pecan_728x90\"></a></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>", "domain": "9to5mac.com", "author": "Benjamin Mayo", "url": "http://9to5mac.com/2016/04/05/apple-music-featuring-commemorative-anniversary-playlist-songs-from-apple-ads-over-the-last-40-years/", "short_url": "http://rdd.me/wpbsiepp", "title": "Apple Music featuring commemorative anniversary playlist, songs from Apple ads over the last 40 years", "excerpt": "Continuing the celebrations of its 40th birthday, Apple has posted a special&#xA0;Apple Music playlist featuring songs from Apple ads over the last four decades.
