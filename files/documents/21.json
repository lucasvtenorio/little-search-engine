If it doesn&#x2019;t introduce anything new in terms of colors with the next-generation <i>iPhone 7 </i>this fall, the device will have pretty much the same color options since the iPhone 5s (rose gold aside), and &#xA0;not much to get excited about aesthetically&#xA0;for&#xA0;current iPhone users. And the fact that the <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2015/09/27/iphone-7-waterproof-design-rumors/\"><span class=\"s2\">iPhone 7 is said to retain the same metal design</span></a> as the previous generation doesn&#x2019;t help things&#x2026;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Perhaps Apple determined after its iPhone 5c experiment that a broader range of colors outside the boring black/gray/gold palette aren&#x2019;t what iPhone users want? </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But what about an update even on the current colors.&#xA0;</span><span class=\"s1\">Apple has a lot of inspiration to draw on with the Apple Watch lineup, which unlike the rest of Apple&#x2019;s product lineup, has as a much wider range of color options outside of the boring iPhone colors. A space-jet-black anyone?&#xA0;</span><span class=\"s1\">And with the iPod line all but dead, Apple has quite a muted color palette for its products going forward if it doesn&#x2019;t inject some new life into the iPhone&#x2019;s look. I personally liked a lot of the iPhone 5c models, but I never had a chance to own one as I prefer&#xA0;to stick with the more capable flagship models.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But the&#xA0;latest rumors say the next iPhone will <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/29/iphone-7-thinner-same-design-stereo-speakers/\"><span class=\"s2\">largely retain most of the previous generation device</span></a> save for a slightly thinner iPhone 6-like body, flush camera, stereo speakers, and thinner Lightning port (and <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2016/03/13/purported-iphone-7-chassis-pictures-show-redesigned-antenna-lines-new-larger-camera/\"><span class=\"s2\">possibly some redesigned antenna lines?</span></a>). So it sounds like Apple isn&#x2019;t going to change much in terms of the materials used on the device, which might not bode well for my hopes of new color options. There was <a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2015/09/27/iphone-7-waterproof-design-rumors/\"><span class=\"s2\">one rumor</span></a> a while back, however, that it was considering a new casing material and water and dustproof design, but that report conflicts with the more recent and more reliable reports mentioned above.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What do you think? Is it time&#xA0;Apple refreshes its color palette for the iPhone 7?
